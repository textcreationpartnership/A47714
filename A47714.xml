         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This Entry for the Condition broken is not to have ≈øo violent a retro≈øpect to the fir≈øt livery to which the Condition was annexed, that it ≈øhall defeat all things mean between the Creation and the breach of the Condition, but it ≈øhall defeat all mean things which ri≈øe upon the act of the party, as Rent, Dower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But charges which accrue by rea≈øon of Tenure, do remain, notwith≈øtanding the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for the Condition broken: As if ≈øuch a Tenant of the King ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Feoffment in Fee upon condition, which is broken, the Feoffee dieth ≈øei≈øed, his Heir of full age, the Feoffor re-entereth, this re-entry by force of the condition broken hath not ≈øo avoided the de≈øcent, but the King ≈øhall have Relief upon the ≈øaid de≈øcent, for the Relief is para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the Livery, and the condition.

Another matter was to con≈øider, what intere≈øt the Queen hath in the Lands of Fugitives by the common Law; And as to that they were all clear of opinion,<note place="margin">Fugitives.</note> that the Queen in ≈øuch ca≈øe as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaid may ≈øeize, and a≈ø≈øign her intere≈øt over: And that ≈øuch A≈ø≈øignees may grant Copy-holds, parcel of the Manor a≈ø≈øigned, which grants ≈øhall bind him who cometh in after, <hi>cum manus Domini regis amoventur;</hi> and al≈øo when the Statutes of 13 and 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> come,<note place="margin">Dy. 375 b.</note> the Statutes do not amend the e≈øtate of the Queen, but the e≈øtate of the Queen doth continue as before, and all the E≈øtates under it.

               <p>IN the Dutchy Chamber, the ca≈øe was, that King <hi>E</hi> 6. lea≈øed for years certain lands parcel of his Dutchy of <hi>Lanca≈øter,</hi> rendring rent, with clau≈øe of re-entry, and that a lea≈øe was made to one <hi>Bunny;</hi> It was found by Office that the Rent was arrear, and by another Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that the Servant of the ≈øaid Le≈ø≈øee, had tendred the rent in his ab≈øence, and by the commandment of his Ma≈øter, and that afterwards one <hi>I.

And as to the matter which hath been objected, becau≈øe a Court cannot now begin, the ≈øame is not any rea≈øon, for the Court Baron is incident to the Manor, and al≈øo to every part of the Manor, and tran≈øitory through the whole Manor, and if Sir <hi>Fr.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53034:20"/>
the term for years, as lately it hath been adjudged. And a warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be divided, as if a Feoffment in Fee be made to two with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and the one of them relea≈øeth the warranty: <hi>vide L.</hi> 5. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 103. <hi>A.</hi> ≈øei≈øed of a Manor which extendeth in four Towns, <hi>B.

And he cited al≈øo a Ca≈øe 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 3. The Lord of a Manor erected a Chapel within his ≈øaid Manor as a Chapel of Ca≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and afterwards it is a Pari≈øh-Church, now it is become pre≈øentable; an Advow≈øon appendant, as the ≈øoil upon the which the Church is built is parcel of the Manor. See 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 9. One Manor may be parcel of another Manor, as <hi>A.</hi> holdeth of <hi>B.</hi> twenty acres of Land, as of his Manor of <hi>C.</hi> which Manor <hi>B.</hi> holdeth of <hi>D.</hi> as of his Manor of <hi>E.

And as to that which hath been objected concerning a Court Baron which ought to belong to this new Manor, and that ≈øuch a Court cannot now at this day be erected, and therfore here cannot be a Manor; here needs not the erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any new Court, but fora≈ømuch as the Court Baron before this grant might be by Law holden in any place within the Manor: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every part of the Demeans of the Manor is capable of a Court to be holden there. As where one is ≈øei≈øed of a Manor to which an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow≈øon is appendant, now is the Advow≈øon appendant not only to the ≈øaid Manor, but to every part of it; for if he alien an acre, parcel of the Manor with the Advow≈øon, the Advow≈øon is now appendant to the ≈øaid acre: See 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 26. So in the Ca≈øe at Bar, becau≈øe this liberty and franchi≈øe of a Manor is throughout the whole Manor, and in every part of the Services and Deme≈ønes upon this grant of the Services and Deme≈ønes in <hi>North-kel≈øey,</hi> and of his Manor in <hi>North-kel≈øey,</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor pa≈ø≈øeth; which <hi>Windham</hi> al≈øo granted and agreed unto.

But afterwards by a private Act it was done, by which it is enacted, That the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Wales</hi> ≈øhould procure the Epi≈øtles and Go≈øpels to be tran≈ølated, and read in the Wel≈øh Language, which matter our Pre≈øentee might do by a Curate well enough: And he conceived, that by divers Statutes, Aliens by the Common Law were capable of Benefices. See the Statute of 7 <hi>H</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>H</hi> 5 <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. 14 <hi>H</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. and before the ≈øaid la≈øt Statute Iri≈øh-men were capable of Benefices. <hi>Gawdy</hi> Serjeant contrary: and he confe≈ø≈øed, that at the Common Law the defects afore≈øaid were not any cau≈øes of refu≈øal; but now by rea≈øon of a private Act made, 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Entituled, An Act made for the tran≈ølating of the Bible, and of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service into the Wel≈øh tongue, the ≈øame defect is become a good cau≈øe of refu≈øal; in which Act the mi≈øchief is recited, <hi>viz.</hi> That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Wales</hi> did not under≈øtand the Language of <hi>England,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was Enacted, That the Bi≈øhops of <hi>Wales</hi> ≈øhould procure ≈øo many of the Bibles and Books of Common Prayer to be imprinted in the Wel≈øh Language, as there are Pari≈øhes and Cathedral Churches in <hi>Wales,</hi> and ≈øo upon this Statute, this imperfection is become a good cau≈øe of refu≈øal.

Ioynt-tenants are equally capable to make partition as Coparceners were by the Common Law; Now Partition betwixt Ioynt-tenants within age is as ≈øtrong as betwixt Parceners within age. But as to that point it was ≈øaid by the Lord <hi>Ander≈øon,</hi> that it is very true, that upon the ≈øaid Statute the want of the Wel≈øh Language in the Pre≈øentee is now become a good cau≈øe of refu≈øal; but becau≈øe the ≈øaid Act being a private Act hath not been pleaded by the Defendant, we ought not to give our Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to that Act, but according to the Common Law. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter was moved, becau≈øe here appeareth no ≈øufficient notice given to the Patron after the ≈øaid Refu≈øal, for the Plaintiff did pre≈øent the thirtenth of <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> (the Church voyding the fourteenth of <hi>March</hi> before) the nine and twentieth of <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> the ≈øix months expired; the fourth of <hi>September</hi> the Defendant gave notice to the Patron of the refu≈øal, and the fourteenth of <hi>September</hi> was the Collation; and it was ≈øaid by the Lord <hi>Ander≈øon,</hi> that it appeareth here, that there are two and twenty days between the Pre≈øentment and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which is too large a delay: And the Defendant hath not ≈øhewed in his Plea any cau≈øe for the ju≈øtifying or excu≈øe of it

And as unto the fir≈øt i≈ø≈øue, the Ca≈øe upon the Evidence was: that the late Lord <hi>Wind≈øore</hi> was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of certain Sheep, and by his Will devi≈øed them unto <hi>Eliz.</hi> his Daughter for her advancement in marriage, and of his Will made his Wife his Executrix, and died, his Wife took to her Husband one <hi>Puttenham,</hi> who being thus po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed lea≈øed the ≈øaid Sheep with a Farm for eleven years by Indenture, upon which it was agreed between the ≈øaid parties, that the Le≈ø≈øee ≈øhould keep ≈øo much of the Rent re≈øerved upon the ≈øaid Lea≈øe, to buy therewith ≈øo many Cattle over, ≈øo as the whole ≈øtock of the ≈øaid Sheep upon the ≈øaid Farm ≈øhould amount to the number of one thou≈øand Cattle; and the Le≈ø≈øee al≈øo covenanted to yeild and render to the ≈øaid <hi>Puttenham</hi> at the end of the ≈øaid Term one thou≈øand Sheep between two years ≈øhorne, and four years ≈øhorne. Afterwards <hi>Puttenham</hi> by his deed gave unto one <hi>A.</hi> who had married the ≈øaid <hi>Eliz.</hi> the ≈øaid one thou≈øand Cattle, to have them after the ≈øaid Term; the Term expired; <hi>Puttenham</hi> ≈øold and granted them unto <hi>Wood,</hi> who brought them away with him. And the ≈øaid <hi>A.</hi> pretending that the ≈øaid Sheep pa≈ø≈øed to him by the ≈øaid grant of <hi>Puttenham</hi> during the ≈øaid Term, ≈øei≈øed them, and the ≈øame was <hi>noctanter</hi> as they were driven in the high-way, <hi>unde magna contentio orta ≈øuit</hi> between the ≈øaid parties, the one charging the other with felony, whereupon the Con≈øtable of the Town where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ≈øuppo≈øing the ≈øaid matter would grow to an Outrage, ≈øei≈øed the ≈øaid Cattle as felons goods, and afterwards went to the hou≈øe of the ≈øaid <hi>Fo≈øter,</hi> which was near unto the high-way, and asked his advi≈øe upon the matter, but he would not meddle therewith: Afterwards one <hi>Perkins,</hi> who had bought the ≈øaid Cattle of the ≈øaid <hi>A.</hi> came to <hi>Fo≈øter,</hi> and ≈øhewed to him, that the high-ways there were not ≈øufficient for pa≈øturage of the ≈øaid Cattle until the ≈øaid controver≈øy be determined, and prayed that the Cattle be delivered to him the ≈øaid <hi>Perkins</hi> to keep in the mean time; to whom <hi>Fo≈øter</hi> an≈øwered, that if the ≈øaid <hi>Perkins</hi> would find ≈øufficient ≈øure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to deliver back the Cattle to him who had right, that he would be content the ≈øaid <hi>Perkins</hi> ≈øhould take them; whereupon the ≈øaid <hi>Perkins</hi> was bound to <hi>Fo≈øter</hi> to that purpo≈øe, and took away with him the ≈øaid Cattle; And it was al≈øo given in Evidence, that the ≈øervants of the ≈øaid <hi>Fo≈øter</hi> had ≈øei≈øed the Cattle for the u≈øe of their Ma≈øter. And by the clear opinion of the Court upon the whole matter ≈øhewed, <hi>Fo≈øter non cepit,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ≈øuch direction of the Court the Iury found, that <hi>Fo≈øter non cepit;</hi> and as to the matter of property, the Court was clear of opinion, that the grant made by <hi>Puttenham</hi> of the ≈øaid Cattle, during the Term, was utterly void, for <hi>Puttenham</hi> during the ≈øame Term had not in the ≈øaid Cattle either a general or a ≈øpecial property, nor al≈øo after the Term; but if after the Term expired the Le≈ø≈øee will not according to his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant deliver to <hi>Puttenham</hi> one thou≈øand Sheep, then <hi>Puttenham</hi> is put to his Action of covenant, for here the Le≈ø≈øee was bound to deliver to <hi>Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham</hi> at the end of the Term, not the ≈øame Cattle which were lea≈øed, but ≈øuch a number of Sheep, and the ≈øame ought to be between two years ≈øhorne, and four years ≈øhorne, which could not be the Sheep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed, for they did exceed ≈øuch degree before the end of the ≈øaid term, &amp; then the grant of <hi>Puttenham</hi> during the Term is meerly void: And then when after the Term, the Le≈ø≈øee, according to the covenant, delivered to <hi>Wood</hi> one thou≈øand Sheep, he might well ≈øell them to the Plaintiff;

And by <hi>Ander≈øon, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> and <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that defect in the Office is ≈øupplyed by the Count, for there it is expre≈ø≈øly alledged, that the ≈øaid <hi>Richard</hi> died ≈øei≈øed.

relyed upon the rea≈øon of <hi>Windham,</hi> and ≈øo ≈øei≈øed. Another Exception was taken to the Bar,<note place="margin">Averrment.</note> becau≈øe in pleading of the Fine, it is not averred, that the Conu≈øor at the time of the Fine levyed was of full age, out of pri≈øon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as to that <hi>Rhodes</hi> took the difference between the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Statute of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 3. where the≈øe di≈øabilities are within the purview of the ≈øaid Statute, and upon the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. where in the body of the Statute no mention is made of them, but afterwards in an e≈øpecial Exception by it ≈øelf; and he cited the opinion of the Iu≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, e≈øpecially of the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> in the Ca≈øe reported by <hi>Plowd.</hi> 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 365. betwixt <hi>Stowel</hi> and the Lord <hi>Zouch. Periam</hi> to the ≈øame intent, and upon the ≈øame rea≈øon, and further he ≈øaid that although the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. contains in its purview the ≈øame di≈øabilities; Yet this Fine is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and therefore the pleading of the ≈øame ≈øhall not be directed nor waged by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which doth not alter the pleading of a Fine which was before, nor the rea≈øon of it; for it is not properly a Statute, nor do Fines receive any ≈øtrength or virtue by it, but is but a con≈øtruction of the ≈øaid former Statute. And he put the Ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Hide</hi> and <hi>Umpton;</hi> where <hi>Umpton</hi> mean betwixt the Statutes of 32 and 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Declared his Will of all his Lands, which devi≈øe if it be good for two parts of the Land devi≈øed it was doubted, or that the devi≈øe ≈øhould be void for the whole; afterwards came the Stat. of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and cleared the doubt, for to that intent it was made; and in the ≈øaid Statute there is a Provi≈øo, that the ≈øaid Statute ≈øhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Will or the Devi≈øe of <hi>Tho. Umpton,</hi> or ≈øhall be prejudicial or hurtful to any per≈øon or per≈øons for any Lands <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contained or ≈øpecified in the ≈øaid Will or Devi≈øe, but that the ≈øaid Will and Devi≈øe ≈øhall ≈øtand, remain and be in the ≈øame ca≈øe, in force and effect in the Law, as the ≈øame was before the making of this Act. Now, notwith≈øtanding that Provi≈øo, the Will of <hi>Umpton</hi> was holden good but for two parts, for ≈øo the Statute of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. con≈øtrued the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. So in our Ca≈øe, the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Fines con≈øtrues the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. to extend to Fines levyed by Tenant in tail, therefore the e≈øtate tail ≈øhall be adjudged in Law to be bound by the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and not by 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which is rather a Iudgment upon the ≈øaid Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. than any new Statute. <hi>Windham</hi> to the ≈øame intent, and he relyed upon the rea≈øon afore≈øaid. And further ≈øaid, if one will plead a Lea≈øe made by Tenant in tail upon the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. he need not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the full age of the Le≈ø≈øor, and yet that quality of full age is within the purview of the ≈øaid Statute. Fir≈øt all Lea≈øes to be made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by any per≈øon being of full age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ≈øo is the common u≈øe of pleadings. And of the ≈øame opinion was the Lord <hi>Ander≈øon</hi> for the ≈øaid Exception, for the rea≈øons, and upon the difference afore≈øaid. Another Exception was taken to the Bar, becau≈øe it is not alledged, that the ≈øaid Fine was engro≈ø≈øed in the ≈øame Term in which it was levyed. And as to that, it was holden by <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that in pleading of a Fine it needs not to ≈øhew any engro≈ø≈øing of it; and ≈øo are many Pre≈øidents, <hi>vide Plowd. Com.

levyed: And ≈øo, admit, that in pleading it ought to be ≈øhewed that the Fine was ingro≈ø≈øed in the ≈øame Term in which it was levyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now it appears here to us by nece≈ø≈øary con≈øequence, that the Fine was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro≈ø≈øed accordingly.

And of the ≈øame opinion was <hi>Windham,</hi> and upon the ≈øame rea≈øon <hi>Ander≈øon</hi> conceived, that the Tenant in pleading of the Fine ought to ≈øhew in expre≈øs words, that the Fine was engro≈ø≈øed the ≈øame Term in which it was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed; for who≈øoever in pleading a plea will take the benefit of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ought preci≈øely to follow the Statute in all points; and it is clear, that if the Fine be not engro≈ø≈øed, according to the Statute, that then it is not any bar by the Statute, and therefore it ought to be expre≈øly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged according to the Statute, and not by implication only.</p>
               <p>Another Exception was taken to the Bar (as was remembred by <hi>Windham) i. pro ut per finem hic in Curia de recordo remanen-plenius apparet;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øaying, <hi>&amp; per proclamation. inde, &amp;c.</hi> But that Exception was di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed by <hi>Periam</hi> and <hi>Windham,</hi> for the Fine had been good and well pleaded, without any ≈øuch conclu≈øion, <hi>pro ut, &amp;c.</hi> And al≈øo the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are endor≈øed upon the Fine, and then they appear upon the Fine, according to the words of the ≈øaid conclu≈øion.

                  <hi>Ander≈øon</hi> to the ≈øame intent. The Replication for want of Traver≈øe is incurable, for we as Iudges do not know what to do, becau≈øe that the truth of the matter in fact doth not appear unto us, and ≈øo neither the matter in Law; for every plea ought to be traver≈øed, or confe≈ø≈øed, and avoided, otherwi≈øe nothing appears to us, and we cannot know whether the Conu≈øor or <hi>Bamfield</hi> were ≈øei≈øed at the time of the Fine le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed, for otherwi≈øe the matter in Law cannot ri≈øe; and yet I well know, that although a traver≈øe may be ≈øpared in re≈øpect of a matter in Law which ≈øhould be choaked and put out of the Book by the traver≈øe, or for the mi≈øchief of the tryal as afore≈øaid, where a thing is alledged to be done beyond ≈øea. 19 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 6.

the Plaintiff by Replication ≈øaid, that he him≈øelf was born at <hi>D.</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the County of <hi>York,</hi> there he ≈øhall not take a traver≈øe without that, that he was born at <hi>Denmark,</hi> for there ≈øuch tryal connot be, but in ≈øuch ca≈øe the Defendant by way of Rejoynder ≈øhall ≈øay, that the Plaint. was born at <hi>Denmark,</hi> without that that he was born at <hi>D.</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>York:</hi> And it is true, a ≈øuppo≈øal of a Writ or Count may be an≈øwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an Affirmative; but a matter alledged by expre≈øs words cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rhodes,</hi> admitting now that the Bar be naught, and the Replication faulty, as it is, then I conceive, that if the point of the Action be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed by the Bar, the Court ≈øhall give Iudgment upon the Bar, and ≈øhall not meddle with the Replication; but if it be not confe≈ø≈øed by the Bar, that then there ≈øhall be a Repleader. And I do conceive, that a Repleader may be awarded upon a Demurrer in Law: which ≈øee <hi>Plowd.</hi> 1 <hi>Ma.</hi> in the Ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Be≈øton</hi> 138. In Tre≈øpa≈øs the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff doth ≈øuppo≈øe the Tre≈øpa≈øs in two places, <hi>≈øcil.</hi> in <hi>Berme≈øtreet</hi> and in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey;</hi> as to the Tre≈øpa≈øs in <hi>Southwark</hi> the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant doth ju≈øtifie by ≈øpecial matter of a Lea≈øe, without an≈øwering any thing to the Tre≈øpa≈øs in <hi>Berme≈øtreet.</hi> The Plaintiff doth reply, and makes his title by a Lea≈øe more ancient than the Lea≈øe to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; upon which the Defendant doth demurr in Law. Now the defect in the Bar appearing, the Court awarded a Repleader. And 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 35. in a Replevin the Defendant avowed for damage fe≈øant. The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff made title by Common. The Defendant pleaded a Relea≈øe of the Common by deed, which was not a perfect deed, upon which the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff did demurr in Law: And the Replication, in which the imperfect Relea≈øe was, was holden naught, but becau≈øe there was a defect in the Bar to the Avowry by the title of Common, the Court awarded, that the parties ≈øhould replead, not in re≈øpect of the vitious plea upon which it was demurred, but in re≈øpect of the defect in Bar: And ≈øo in this Ca≈øe <hi>Periam</hi> ≈øaid, that nothing ≈øhould be awarded in this Ca≈øe but where an I≈ø≈øue is joyned, for an I≈ø≈øue is always joyned upon a point certain. But upon a demurrer all the parts of the pleading, the Count, the Bar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are referred to the Court, as well for the form as for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Book which hath been vouched to the contrary out of 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. I have procured ≈øearch to be made for the Roll, but it cannot be found, and it is inconvenient, that after a demurrer a Repleader ≈øhould be granted, for then Cau≈øes ≈øhould never have an end: And as to the Ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Be≈øton,</hi> the Repleader there was permitted by the a≈ø≈øent of the parties, rather then awarded by the Rule of the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Windham</hi> to the ≈øame intent, that no Repleader ≈øhall be in this Ca≈øe, and he ≈øaid, that in the time of the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> the opinion of the Court was ≈øo: And as this ca≈øe is, the plea a Bar being good, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer being upon the Replication, no Repleader ≈øhould be, for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleader ≈øhall never be granted, where the plea upon a Demurrer is not good; but if the Bar be not good, and the Defendant doth demurr up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Replication, there a Repleader may be. And as to <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Be≈øtons</hi> Ca≈øe he conceived, that the parties did plead <hi>de novo,</hi> but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead, for if it had been a Repleader, then the parties ≈øhould begin to plead where the fir≈øt defect was, as if the defect be in the Bar, there the Repleader ≈øhall begin, but the Declaration ≈øhall ≈øtand: But in the ≈øaid Ca≈øe of <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Be≈øton,</hi> the Plaintiff pleaded all <hi>de novo,</hi> as a new Count, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet the fir≈øt defect was in the Bar, and therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that there it was not a Repleader, but that the parties by a≈ø≈øent did plead <hi>de novo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ander≈øon</hi> was of opinion, that as this Ca≈øe is, no Repleader ≈øhall be, and yet he held the Repleader might be upon a Demurrer as well as upon an I≈ø≈øue joyned; For a Demurrer joyned is an I≈ø≈øue to be tryed by the Iudges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ≈øuch was the opinion of <hi>Manwood</hi> chief Baron. And the Iudgment in the Ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Be≈øton</hi> is not that the parties
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53034:47"/>
≈øhall plead <hi>de novo,</hi> but that they ≈øhall replead. See there <hi>folio</hi> 138. <hi>a.</hi> and in that Ca≈øe there might well be a Repleader, for there the truth of the matter in fact is confe≈ø≈øed in the pleading, but in the Ca≈øe at Bar it is otherwi≈øe, for the pleading is ≈øo ob≈øcure, that we do not know the truth of the matter, and the right of the matter doth not appear unto us.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Periam,</hi> as to that which hath been ≈øaid, that upon the demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer upon the Replication, the ≈øei≈øin of <hi>Bamfield</hi> at the time of the Fine is confe≈ø≈øed. Sir, its not ≈øo, for no more ≈øhall be holden confe≈ø≈øed by a demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but that which is duly and ≈øufficiently pleaded, and becau≈øe the ≈øei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øin of <hi>Bamfield</hi> is not ≈øufficiently pleaded, therefore not confe≈ø≈øed; and for proof of that learning, ≈øee the Ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Wimbi≈øh</hi> and <hi>Talboies;</hi> and the Ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Graunge:</hi> 1 <hi>Mar. Plowd.</hi> 171. and ≈øee the Ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Partridge</hi> and <hi>Croker;</hi> and ≈øo was opinion of the Lord <hi>Ander≈øon,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed much upon the Ca≈øe, where it is ≈øaid, that in pleading a plea, all matters in fact well and materially alledged by a general Demurrer are confe≈ø≈øed to be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rhodes.</hi> Now we are to ≈øee, if by the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Replication may be ≈øalved, and I conceive, that this Statute doth extend to all imperfections which happen by the Act; Mi≈øpri≈øion, or negligence of the Clarks or Coun≈øel; for the Clyent propounds his Cau≈øe to the Clark and his Coun≈øel to manage in the cour≈øe of his ≈øuit, and if the Clark or Coun≈øel err therein, or in that which to them belongeth, the C≈øyent as to that ≈øhall be releived by the Statute; but if there be any defect in the matter, ≈øo as the matter will not ≈øerve, it is otherwi≈øe. As 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. In the Roll of a plea there were divers ≈øpaces (for the year and day) void and blank, in another Term, the Iudges could not amend them, but now by the ≈øaid Statute they may. So co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in A≈ø≈øi≈øe wanting is helped by this Statute, ≈øo the u≈øual averment, <hi>&amp; hoc paratus e≈øt verificare, &amp;c.</hi> left out, the Court hath power to amend it, and ≈øo by him the Court by this Statute hath power to amend that defect in Tre≈øpa≈øs.</p>

                  <hi>Periam</hi> to the contrary. And that this default of Traver≈øe is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable by the ≈øaid Statute, for it is enacted by the ≈øaid Statute, that upon a Demurrer the Iudges ≈øhall give Iudgment as the right of the cau≈øe and matter in Law ≈øhall require; but in our ca≈øe, as the pleading now is, no right of the cau≈øe or matter in Law appeareth according to which we can judge, for we upon this pleading cannot tell whether the Conu≈øor or <hi>Bamfield</hi> was ≈øei≈øed at the time of the Fine levyed, for upon the Demurrer upon the Replication the ≈øei≈øin of <hi>Bamfield</hi> is not confe≈ø≈øed, becau≈øe it is not well alledged: And if it had been well alledged, yet it had not been confe≈ø≈øed, becau≈øe that the Tenant who demurrs upon the Replication, hath in his Bar expre≈øly alledged, that the Conu≈øor was ≈øei≈øed: An Original Writ of Debt again≈øt one as Executor in the <hi>debet</hi> and <hi>detinet</hi> could not be amended by 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. but now by the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it may.

And he argued much upon the dignity of Fines out of <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Glanvil,</hi> whom he called <hi>Actores, non Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thores Legis;</hi> &amp; that Fines at the common Law were of great authority until the Statute of <hi>We≈øt.</hi> 2. And afterwards by the Statute of 34 <hi>E.</hi> 3. of non-claim, from whence they became to be of ≈øo little value in Law, that they were accounted no other than Feoffments upon Record, ≈øo as thereby no a≈ø≈øurance was of Inheritances but a general incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty until the Statute of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. by which Statute they were re≈øtored to their ancient power and virtue: After which Statute many ≈øhifts were devi≈øed, to creep out of it: So as the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made to take away all que≈øtions and ambiguities which were conceived upon the ≈øaid Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. And therefore we who are Iudges ought to frame our Iudgments for the maintaining of the authority of Fines, for ≈øo the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions and inheritances of the Subjects ≈øhall be pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; And that is the rea≈øon, that if a ≈øtranger levy a Fine of my Land in my name, that I have not any remedy but a Writ of Deceit again≈øt him who levyes the Fine, ≈øo if a Feme-covert levyeth a Fine of her Land as a Feme-≈øole, the ≈øame ≈øhall bind her after the coverture, if the Husband do not enter upon the Conu≈øee during the coverture and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion gained by the Fine: And 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and our Books are very plentiful to this purpo≈øe that the Law doth <hi>aerge</hi> admit of ≈øuch allegations again≈øt ≈øuch Fines: A Fine was pleaded in Bar of Land in <hi>A.

               <p>
                  <hi>Periam</hi> to the ≈øame intent: It ≈øhould be very dangerous to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances of the Subjects to admit of ≈øuch Averments, and by ≈øuch means Fines which ≈øhould be of great force and effect ≈øhould be much weakned, and he put many Ca≈øes to the ≈øame purpo≈øe as were put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Rhodes</hi> Iu≈øtice, and he ≈øhewed how that Fines, and the power of them were much weakned by the Statute of non-claim, whereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed (as the preface of the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. ob≈øerveth) the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øal trouble of the Kings Subjects, and therefore by the ≈øaid Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Fines, for the good and ≈øafety of the Subjects were re≈øtored to their former Grandure and authority, which ≈øhould be con≈øtrued by us who are Iudges, ≈øtrongly and liberally for the quiet and e≈øtabli≈øhment of pre≈øent po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions, and for the barring and extingui≈øhing of former rights, and ≈øo did the Iudges our Predece≈ø≈øors; which ≈øee in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ≈øaid Ca≈øe between <hi>Stowel</hi> and the Lord <hi>Zouch:</hi> So ≈øee ≈øuch liberal con≈øtruction, 19 <hi>Eliz.

Where if Land be given to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife in ≈øpecial tail, and the Husband alone levieth a Fine and dieth having I≈ø≈øue, the I≈ø≈øue is barred: And it hath lately been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the advice of all the Iudges of <hi>England,</hi> upon the Statute of 1 <hi>Ma. viz.</hi> All Fines levied, whereupon Proclamations ≈øhall not be day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made by rea≈øon of Adjournment of any Term, ≈øhall be of as good force and ≈øtrength to all intents and purpo≈øes, as if ≈øuch Term had been holden and kept from the beginning to the end thereof, and not adjourned, and the Proclamations ≈øhall be made in the following Term, which rea≈øon in con≈øtruction of the ≈øaid Statute, the Iudges in the ca≈øe of the <hi>Cooks</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> 20. <hi>Eliz.</hi> have ob≈øerved, which ≈øee <hi>Plowden</hi> 538. For although Succe≈ø≈øors are not mentioned in the ≈øaid Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. but only Heirs, yet the Iudges did con≈øtrue the ≈øaid Statute to extend to them that they ≈øhould be bounden as well as the Heirs; for it is in the like mi≈øchief, and the ≈øaid Statute was made for the publick good, and for the repo≈øe of the Inheritances of the Subjects of this Realm, and therefore the ≈øame ought to be largely extended in the meaning and ≈øen≈øe of it, and for the benefit of the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øors of the Lands, and to the de≈øtroying of former rights which were not claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It hath been ≈øaid, that this Fine is but a Fine by conclu≈øion, and not in verity; and therefore not within the Statute. But without que≈øtion, Fines by conclu≈øion are within the Statute. And that is clear by the Saving, <hi>≈øcil.</hi> to all per≈øons other than parties to the ≈øaid Fines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Periam</hi> was again≈øt the opinion in <hi>Stowells</hi> Ca≈øe by <hi>Sanders</hi> 356. A Di≈ø≈øei≈øor maks a Feoffment in fee upon condition, the Feoffee levies a Fine with Proclamation, five years pa≈øs, the condition is broken, the Di≈ø≈øei≈ø≈øor re-entreth, and <hi>Periam</hi> conceived that in ≈øuch Ca≈øe the Di≈ø≈øei≈ø≈øee is bounden, for by the Fine, and five years non-claim, the right of every ≈øtranger is barred, and when the Di≈ø≈øei≈ø≈øor entreth for the condition broken, the Fine is not annoyed, but rather confirmed, and former rights ≈øhall not be revived. <hi>Windham</hi> to the ≈øame intent, and vouched the Books before remembred, and that the meaning of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. made upon the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. was to bind the I≈ø≈øue in tail as ≈øtrongly as the heir of Tenant in Fee-≈øimple was bound at the common Law, and that Fines by conclu≈øion are as fully within the purview of that Statute as Fines in verity, for Fines by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øion are A≈ø≈øurances; And as to the objection again≈øt our Fine, that it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53034:49"/>
is not <hi>rite levatus</hi> becau≈øe that <hi>partes ad finem nihil habuerunt, &amp;c.</hi> the ≈øame is no rea≈øon, wherefore this Fine ≈øhould not be <hi>rite levatus,</hi> for the≈øe words <hi>rite levatus,</hi> to the external form of a Fine are to be taken as to a Fine levied, <hi>coram Edmundo Ander≈øon &amp; ≈øocijs ≈øuis,</hi> where all the Iu≈øtices ought to be named, and ≈øo it ≈øeemed al≈øo to <hi>Periam</hi> and <hi>Ander≈øon.</hi> Our ca≈øe had little re≈øemblance to the Ca≈øe where Tenant in tail maks a Lea≈øe according to the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. if he be not ≈øei≈øed at the time of the demi≈øe, it is void; for the Stat. ≈øpeaks ≈øei≈øed in tail: but ≈øo are not penned the Statutes of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. as 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. a Fine levied ≈øhall bind privies, &amp; ≈øtrangers, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Fines levied of any Lands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed to the Conu≈øor or any of his Ance≈øtors, and it is not a Fine in re≈øpect of the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion which pa≈ø≈øeth by the Fine, but in re≈øpect of the Concord and Agreement,</p>
               <p>And Tenant in tail by the≈øe Statutes hath as great power to bind the right of the entail, although he cannot meddle with the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, as the Tenant in Fee-≈øimple at the common Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ander≈øon</hi> to the ≈øame intent, All the matter re≈øts upon this point, if the I≈ø≈øue in tail be privy or not, for if he be privy, then clearly he is bounden. And as to that, the I≈ø≈øue in tail before the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath been always accounted privy. See 29 <hi>H</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 32. Tenant in tail of the gift of the King levieth a Fine, the ≈øame ≈øhall bind his I≈ø≈øue, for they are privy. And he argued much upon the Ca≈øes cited by the other Iu≈øtices before, and e≈øpecially upon the ≈øaid Ca≈øe of <hi>Stowel</hi> and the Lord <hi>Zouch;</hi> how that the I≈ø≈øue in tail is there holden privy; and that the Statute of Fines ought to be taken and con≈øtrued to enfore the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of Fines again≈øt former rights, and for the e≈øtabli≈øhment of the pre≈øent po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions and e≈øtates. And by him divers rights and per≈øons are excepted by the ≈øaid Statute, but this right in gro≈øs of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, nor the I≈ø≈øue in tail, who≈øe Ance≈øtor being out of po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion levieth the Fine is not excepted, therefore both of them comprehended in the Statute. And in his argument he ≈øtood much upon it, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a matter it ≈øhould be, to receive ≈øuch averments and allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which go meerly in avoidance of Fines, for ≈øo every Fine might fall in the mouth of the Lay-Gens, which would be very inconvenient. And he concluded his Argument with this Ca≈øe. Tenant in tail doth di≈øcontinue, and di≈ø≈øei≈øeth his di≈øcontinnuee, and levieth a Fine, the di≈øcontinuee before the proclamations reentreth, the proclamations are made, Tenant in tail doth re-enter, and dieth ≈øei≈øed; again≈øt this Fine his I≈ø≈øue ≈øhall not be remitted. See as to the averment 3 <hi>H.</hi> 627. 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 18. 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 20. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 8. 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 19. by <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Needham,</hi> and <hi>fol.</hi> 15. by <hi>Brian</hi> and <hi>Choke.</hi> And afterwards Iudgment was given, that the Demandant ≈øhould be barred.</p>

And yet the Iury again≈øt the opinion of the Court upon that evidence found the Defendant guilty. And it was moved in arre≈øt of Iudgment, that the Evidence did not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Information, nor prove the I≈ø≈øue, <hi>ex parte Querentis,</hi> and it was ≈øaid, there are three things within the Statute, <hi>i.</hi> three words, <hi>i.</hi> bargain, loan, and cheivizance, and the≈øe three are ≈øeveral things,

and therefore, if the Information be conceived upon loan, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former giveth in Evidence a corrupt bargain for cloth, as it is in this Ca≈øe, the ≈øame doth not maintain the Information; So if the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be granted upon u≈øurious contract by way of mortgage, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Evidence an u≈øurious loan, <hi>ut ≈øupra.</hi> But if the Information had been conceived generally, upon an u≈øurious agreement, and giveth in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence a loan, the ≈øame is good enough, for every loan is an agreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manwood,</hi> There cannot be any loan without bargain, nor any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing without bargain, for he contracts or bargains to do it, <hi>viz.</hi> to lend, or forbear: Bargain of forbearing is where the fir≈øt day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not kept and the parties have agreed for a further day for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it appeareth in this Ca≈øe, that it was a bargain to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear a ≈øum of mony which ≈øhould have been paid before; And the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation here is upon a bargain by way of loan, where was a bargain for forbearing. <hi>Fuller,</hi> this word (Bargain) in the Statute cannot be intended a bargain for wares or ≈øuch things, and ≈øo di≈øtinct from the other two things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If in Information upon loan, an u≈øurious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract had been given in Evidence, that would not maintain the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: And it was moved in this Ca≈øe, if the time of the loan or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of the money ≈øhall be accounted according to eight &amp; twenty days to every month, or by the months in the Kalender, <hi>viz. January, February, &amp;c.</hi> And it ≈øeemed to ≈øome according to the days, as in ca≈øe of the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of Recu≈øants; and others conceived contrary in both Ca≈øes. And <hi>Fuller</hi> ≈øaid, That in the Ca≈øe of policy of A≈ø≈øurance made to warrant a Ship, one was bound to warrant a Ship for twelve months; &amp; the truth was, ≈øhe did not peri≈øh within the time of the twelve months, being accounted according to eight and twenty days, but being accounted by the Kalender, as <hi>January, Feb. &amp;c.</hi> it peri≈øhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it was ≈øaid and holden, that he had not forfeited his Bond. <hi>Gent</hi> Baron. If I lend one a hundred pounds without any contract for Intere≈øt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at the end of year he gives me twenty pounds for the loan thereof, the ≈øame is within the Statute, for my acceptance makes the offence<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> without any bargain or contract. And by <hi>Clarke</hi> Baron, the place where the Defendant accepted exce≈ø≈øive Intere≈øt ought to be ≈øhewed in the Information, but not the place where the contract for the loan or forbearance was made, for the ≈øame is not needful. See the Ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Stradling</hi> and <hi>Morgan, Plowd.</hi> 200. for the ≈øetting down of the place in the Declaration, where the Extortion was committed: The Information here is by way of corrupt bargain and loan. The Defendant took at <hi>Dertford</hi> ≈øuch a ≈øum, where the taking is layed, <hi>apud Dertford,</hi> but no place of the corrupt bargain or of the loan. And by <hi>Gent.</hi> If I lend to <hi>Bee≈øie</hi> for a year, and afterwards he takes further forbearance of another year beyond the rate, the ≈øame is within the Statute: but in all Ca≈øes, the place where the corrupt bargain was made ought to be certainly alledged: <hi>Manwood</hi> Baron, the Information is not good for the incertainty of the place, where the corrupt bargain was made; and although there are many Pre≈øidents on the Informes part, it is not to purpo≈øe, for they were admitted without exception, and then they pa≈ø≈øed <hi>≈øub ≈øilentio,</hi> and ≈øo of no force. There are three things, or rather degrees of offences within the Statute. In u≈øury, within the Statute, there ought to be corrupt loan, cheivi≈øance, or ≈øhift, 1. corruption, 2. he ought to take more than eight pound for one hundred pounds, 3. it ought to be for lending or forbearing. There was a Ca≈øe in this Court in the time of this Queen, that the Defendant had taken more than ten pounds in the hundred pounds, but in the Information no corruption in the bargain was alledged; and therefore Iudgment was given again≈øt the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: But in the Ca≈øe at Bar corruption is ≈øet forth in <hi>facto,</hi> and therefore as to that the Information is good enough: As unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing &amp; giving of days of payment the ≈øame is alledged in the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53034:55"/>
but not according to the Statute, for the Statute is in the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive, but the Information is in the copulative; here in our Ca≈øe the i≈ø≈øue is Not guilty, under which general i≈ø≈øue all the points of the Statute are included and ought to be tried; as unto the corruption the ≈øame is not ≈øufficiently laid, for no place is a≈ø≈øigned where the corrupt bargain was made, <hi>ergo</hi> no <hi>vi≈øne</hi> for it to be tried, <hi>ergo,</hi> no trial can be, <hi>ergo,</hi> no i≈ø≈øue for it, <hi>ergo,</hi> this point of the Statute doth not come in i≈ø≈øue, nor can it be tried upon the general i≈ø≈øue, Not guilty. Al≈øo he held, that all the Offence ought to be within the year, for if one make a corrupt bargain for this year, and ten years after he takes exce≈ø≈øive u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the ≈øame is not within the Statute to inform upon it. And in truth there is no ≈øuch offence without corrupt bargain, ≈øo as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the word (Lending) is a ≈øtrange word, but where the Statute is forbearing or giving day of payment, &amp; in the Information it is giving and forbearing in the copulative, that is good enough, for the one word enforceth the other, and is not double. Al≈øo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation hath not ≈øhewed who≈øe money it is, and therefore it is not good: And afterwards Iudgment was given again≈øt the Informer; and a Writ of Error thereupon brought in the Erchequer Chamber. And it was argued by <hi>Popham</hi> Attorney General, that Iudgment ought to have been given for the Queen and the Informer, for the ≈øhewing of the place where the corrupt bargain was made needs not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Information, for the offence puni≈øhable by the Statute is the receipt of exce≈ø≈øive u≈øury, and not the contract: And it was the Ca≈øe of one <hi>Bird,</hi> 20 <hi>Eliz.</hi> where the Plaintiff ≈øhewed the place of the Receipt, and not of the contract, and yet had Iudgment for the Queen, without any exception to it before Iudgment, or Error after, for the contract is but inducement to the receipt, and it ≈øhall be tried where the taking was; therefore it is not nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øhew the place of the bargain: And it was adjorned.</p>

for forfeiture of Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, by tho≈øe words they ≈øhall not forfeit Copy-holds. <hi>Clark</hi> Baron, this Statute was made to re≈øtrain Recu≈øants from taking the benefit of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and Copy-holds are their Livings as well as Free-holds, and by this Statute, the Queen ≈øhall not have every e≈øtate in the Copy-hold Land, but only the taking of the profits; but the ≈øcope of the Statute was to impair the Livings of Recu≈øants, and that by driving of them for want of maintenance to repair to the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walme≈øley,</hi> If the Statute had given to the Queen to ≈øei≈øe two parts of their livings, then the Statute had extended to Copy-holds. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> when a Statute is made to transfer an e≈øtate by name of Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, the Copy-hold is not within ≈øuch Statute; but if the Lords Signiory, his Cu≈øtoms and Services, are not to be impeached, or taken away by ≈øuch Statute, then it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe; for ≈øuch Statute doth not make another Tenant to the Lord; And by him Copy-holder ≈øhall pay Sub≈øidies, and he ≈øhall be a≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value of his Copy-hold as well as of his Freehold, and in this Ca≈øe, the Queen is to have the profits of the Lands only, but no e≈øtate. At another day, the ca≈øe was argued for the Recu≈øants by <hi>Snag</hi> Serjeant, and he ≈øaid, that the≈øe words Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments are to be con≈øtrued, which are ≈øuch at the Common Law, not by Cu≈øtom: If I give to one all my Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments in <hi>D.</hi> my Copy-holds do not pa≈øs, and Statutes which are made to take away Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions and Hereditaments out of per≈øons ought to be ≈øtrictly taken, and not by Equity: The Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of Bankrupts enacts, that the Commi≈ø≈øioners may ≈øell the Lands and Tenements of the Bankrupts; if the Statute had not made a further provi≈øion, the Commi≈ø≈øioners could not ≈øell Copy-hold Lands, but there are expre≈øs words in the Statute for that purpo≈øe, <hi>i.e.</hi> as well copy as fee: Al≈øo the Staute of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. of Auditors and Receivers of the Queen doth not extend to Copy-holds: And it ≈øhould be a great prejudice to the Lords of ≈øuch Copy-holds, that the Queen ≈øhould have the Land. <hi>Popham,</hi> the intention of the Law ≈øomtimes cau≈øes a liberal con≈øtruction of a Statute in the letter of it,<note place="margin">What Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes extend to Copy-holds.</note> ≈øomtimes a ≈øtrict and preci≈øe expo≈øition, and here it appeareth, that the intention of the Statute was, that the Queen ≈øhould have all the goods of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and two parts of the Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Lea≈øes and Farms, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øant but the third part of all his Lands only; And therefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øant is not to have any other thing but only that which is allotted to him by the Statute, and that is the third part, which is all the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which the Law allows him; and then if Copy-holds be not within this Statute, a Recu≈øant who hath great po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øions in Copy-holds, and hath no Free-hold ≈øhould be di≈øpuni≈øhable, and hath his full main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, again≈øt the meaning of the Statute: And he ≈øaid that many things are within the meaning of a Statute,<note place="margin">

As if a Feme Covert be bound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Obligee bring her into the Chancery, and if a man threaten me, that if I will not pay to him ten pounds, he will ≈øue me in Chancery, upon which I promi≈øe to pay it him, no Action will lye: And an Infant is not chargeable upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, but for his meat, drink, and nece≈ø≈øary Apparel, 19 <hi>Z.</hi> 4. 2. And in Debt upon ≈øuch nece≈ø≈øary Contract, the Plaintiff ought to declare ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, ≈øo as the whole certainty may appear upon which the Court may judge, if the expen≈øe were nece≈ø≈øary and convenient or not, and upon the rea≈øonablene≈øs of the price, for otherwi≈øe, if the nece≈ø≈øity of the thing, and rea≈øonablene≈øs of the price doth not appear, the Chancellor him≈øelf would not give any remedy, or recompence to the party. <hi>Wray Ju≈øtice</hi> conceived, that the Action would not lye, for the contract was void, and the Infant in an Action again≈øt him upon it may plead <hi>Nihil debet:</hi> And if an Infant ≈øell goods for money and doth not deliver them, but the Vendee takes them, he is a Tre≈øpa≈ø≈øor; but if the Infant had been bounden in an Obligation with a ≈øurety, and afterwards at his full age he in con≈øideration thereof promi≈øeth to keep his ≈øurety harmle≈øs, upon that promi≈øe an Action lyeth, for the Infant cannot plead <hi>non e≈øt factum,</hi> which ≈øee <hi>Mich.</hi> 28, <hi>&amp;</hi> 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Ca≈øe of one <hi>Edmunds:</hi> And afterwards it was adjudged again≈øt the Plaintiff.</p>

                  <hi>Wray,</hi> It is but one Statute, and therefore it ≈øhall be con≈øtrued with one con≈øtruction, and it ≈øhould be a ≈øtrange con≈øtruction, that the King ≈øhould be within one part of the Statute, and out of the other. And 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 3. The Kings Attorney could not have damages, which is a great proof and authority, that the Iudgment for damages in ≈øuch ca≈øe is Error: The experience and u≈øage of Law is ≈øufficient to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the ≈øame to us, and from the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. until now, no damages have been given in ≈øuch ca≈øe.

is not within the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of buying of Tythes, nor any Subjects who buy any title of him: And here in our ca≈øe, the Queen is not <hi>verus Patronus</hi> but hath this pre≈øentment, by Prerogative: And if title do accrue to the Bi≈øhop to pre≈øent for Lap≈øe, yet the Patron is <hi>verus Patronus.</hi>

               <p>At another day the ca≈øe was moved, and it was ≈øaid by <hi>VVray,</hi> that he had conferred with <hi>Ander≈øon, Manwood,</hi> and <hi>Periam,</hi> who held, that the Queen could not have damages in this ca≈øe, but <hi>Periam</hi> ≈øomewhat doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of it. <hi>Gawdy,</hi> In 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 46.

Mariae de Eaton juxta Wind≈øor,</hi> and a Lea≈øe is made by the name <hi>Praepo≈øiti &amp; Sociorum Collegii regalis de Eaton,</hi> and that was holden a void Lea≈øe: And I confe≈øs that in the names of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, we ought to re≈øort to the Foundation of the Corporations, for the name of a Corporation is as a name of Bapti≈øm, &amp; ought to be as preci≈øely ob≈øerved, but that ought to be intended in matter of ≈øub≈øtance, &amp; not otherwi≈øe, <hi>vide</hi> 10 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 278. The Dean &amp; Chapter of <hi>Carlile</hi> was incorporated by the name of <hi>Decanus &amp; Capitul. Eccle≈øiae Cathedralis Sanct. &amp; individuae Tri. Carl.</hi> and they make a Lea≈øe by the name, <hi>Decanus Eccle≈øiae Cathedralis S. Trin. in Cant. et totum Capit. de Eccle≈øia praedict.</hi> And the ≈øame was holden a good Lea≈øe, notwith≈øtanding that variance, which is not in ≈øub≈øtance of the name. And the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Peterborow</hi> was incorporated by the name of <hi>Decanus et Capitul. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle≈øiae Petriburgen≈øis,</hi> and they made a Lea≈øe by the name <hi>Decanus et Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulum Eccle≈øiae de Peterborow,</hi> and holden good enough, becau≈øe the variance was not in any matter of ≈øub≈øtance: And he cited the Ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Croft</hi> and <hi>Howel,</hi> 20 <hi>Eliz. Plow. Com.</hi> 537. The Cooks of <hi>London</hi> were incorporated by the name of Ma≈øters, and Governors,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53034:87"/>
and Commonalty of the Mi≈øtery of Cooks, and they by the Name of Ma≈øter and Wardens of the ≈øaid Craft and Mi≈øtery of Cooks made a Conveyance, and it was holden that the variance a≈ø≈øigned in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of this word <hi>(Craft)</hi> in the Conveyance, which was not in this Corporation, was not any material variance, but only matter of ≈øurplu≈øage, for <hi>(Craft)</hi> and <hi>(My≈øtery)</hi> are all one, and of one ≈øen≈øe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ≈øo in the principal Ca≈øe, The <hi>Ho≈øpital de le Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Ho≈øpital vocat. le Savoy,</hi> ≈øound the ≈øame, and in effect do not differ. And as it was ≈øaid by the Lord Chief Baron in his Argument in the Court of <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> in this ca≈øe, four things are only to be re≈øpected in the Name of a Corporation:<note place="margin">Po≈øt. 162, 164.</note> Fir≈øt the Name of the living per≈øons who are the Corporation, as in our Ca≈øe the Ma≈øter and Chaplains: Secondly, the hou≈øe in which they are re≈øident, and make their aboad: Thirdly, The Name of the Founder: Fourthly, the place upon which the place of their aboad is built and erected. And if the≈øe four matters are ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ≈øet down, although not formally, it is good enough. It hath been objected, That the <hi>Ho≈øpital de le Savoy,</hi> and the Ho≈øpital <hi>vocat. le Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> do much differ, for <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> implieth the demon≈øtration of the Place, but <hi>vocat. le Savoy,</hi> trencheth only to the Name, As if the Dean &amp; Chap. <hi>de Pauls in London,</hi> make a Lea≈øe by the Name of Dean and Chap. of St. <hi>Paul vocat. London,</hi> ≈øo if the Ma≈øter and Fellows of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge; in <hi>Cambridge</hi> make a Lea≈øe by the Name of Ma≈øter &amp; Fellows of <hi>Trinity</hi> Coll. <hi>vocat. Cambridge,</hi> ≈øuch Lea≈øes are utterly void. I do well agree tho≈øe Ca≈øes, for the Dean and Chapter is not all <hi>London,</hi> but part of <hi>London,</hi> and therefore cannot be called or ≈øaid <hi>London;</hi> and ≈øo <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge is but part of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and therefore cannot be called <hi>Cambridge;</hi> but here in our ca≈øe, The Ho≈øpital is not parcel of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> but the whole <hi>Savoy</hi> is the Ho≈øpital, and there is not any part of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> which is not the Ho≈øpital; But if <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> make a Lea≈øe by the Name of Ma≈øter and Fellows <hi>Collegii vocat. Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> it is a good Lea≈øe: And he put a difference, where the word in the Name of the Corporation, which precedes <hi>(de)</hi> is all one and of the ≈øame Nature with the word which follows <hi>(de)</hi> and where on the contrary, as in our ca≈øe, The word which precedes <hi>(de)</hi> is Ho≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and the words which follow <hi>(de)</hi> are <hi>le Savoy,</hi> are all one and the ≈øame thing, ≈øo as the Ho≈øpital and <hi>Savoy</hi> are all one and the ≈øame, and therefore may be well called <hi>Le Savoy,</hi> and al≈øo <hi>(de)</hi> and <hi>(vocat.)</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction are the ≈øame, &amp; ≈øo our Lea≈øe is good enough: And it is found by verdict, That this Ho≈øpital was erected upon the Manor of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and thereupon it is now commonly called <hi>Le Savoy,</hi> without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Ho≈øpital, for as it was called <hi>Savoy</hi> before it was erected into an Ho≈øpital, ≈øo it is al≈øo called after the Erection; and true it is that the mi≈ønaming of a Corporation in any ≈ømall thing ≈øhall abate a Writ, for there is only delay, yet it is not of force in a Conveyance, unle≈øs the mi≈ønaming be in a point material. <hi>Coke</hi> to the contrary, The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance from the true Name of a Corporation which ≈øhall prejudice a Conveyance ought to be in matter of ≈øub≈øtance, for variance in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of form and circum≈øtance will not hurt it, <hi>≈øed parum differunt quae re concordant.</hi> And fir≈øt it is to be confe≈ø≈øed, That the Name of a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is as the Name of Bapti≈øm, which admits of no variance, and therefore it is ≈øaid 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 15. by <hi>Knivet,</hi> when a Man founds a Chantry or a hou≈øe, &amp;c. it ought to bear ≈øuch a Name as his Founder hath given to it, for that is its proper name. And ≈øo it hath been Reported by <hi>Bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes,</hi> Serjeant, 4 and 5 <hi>Phi.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> That it was holden for a po≈øitive Law, by all the Iudges of <hi>England,</hi> That the mi≈øtaking of the Name of a Corporation in any matter of Sub≈øtance, makes the Conveyance ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void, for a name is given to a Corporation upon the Foundation, and that by the ≈øame Name they ≈øhall implead and be impleaded, but that <hi>ut idem nomen, et ≈øub eodem nomine ≈øint habiles ad perquirend. &amp; concedend.</hi> to be impleaded, and to implead, but that is to be meant <hi>idem re,</hi> for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53034:87"/>
it is not nece≈ø≈øary, that it be <hi>idem litera,</hi> for, <hi>qui haeret in litera haeret in Cortice,</hi> but if it be <hi>idem re</hi> with the Foundation it is well enough. And therefore it hath been adjudged, That where the Colledge is incorporated by the Name of Ma≈øters and Fellows <hi>Collegii St. &amp; individ. Trin. in Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brig.</hi> and they make a Lea≈øe by the Name of <hi>Collegii Trin.</hi> this is good enough, for the word Trinity, implies, and imports <hi>St. &amp; individ.</hi> And therefore ≈øuch variance was holden not material. But here in our ca≈øe is a variance in Sub≈øtance, betwixt the Name given to the Ho≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital upon the foundation, and the name u≈øurped in the Lea≈øe. And the ≈øame will clearly appear upon my Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Name given to this Ho≈øpital upon the foundation of it, and the Name u≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Lea≈øe be not <hi>unum in ≈øen≈øu</hi> (not in your private under≈øtanding as private per≈øons, but in your judicial knowledge upon the Record <hi>quod coram vobis re≈øidet,</hi> as Iudges of Record) then this lea≈øe is void; For although you as private per≈øons, otherwi≈øe than by Record, know, That the Ho≈øpital of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Ho≈øpital <hi>vocat. le Savoy,</hi> are all one Ho≈øpital; you ought not upon that your private knowledge to give Iudgment, unle≈øs al≈øo your judicial knowledge agree with it; that is, the knowledge which is out of the Records which you have before you: But if the Name given upon the Foundation, and the u≈øurped Name be not <hi>idem ≈øen≈øu</hi> in your Iudicial knowledge; and you cannot otherwi≈øe conceive the Identity of the≈øe two Ho≈øpitals, nor make any Con≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to imagine it but by the Record, for the Record is your eye of Iu≈øtice, and you have no other eye to look unto the cau≈øe depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, but the Record; and to this purpo≈øe he cited the ca≈øe of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 108. Where a man killed another in the pre≈øence of a Iudge tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling on the way where the murther was, And at the next A≈ø≈øi≈øes in the ≈øaid County before the ≈øame Iudge, another man is indicted of the ≈øame murder, and arraigned, and convicted by verdict; In that ca≈øe, The Iudge he ought not to carry him≈øelf according to his private knowledge, which he hath of the ≈øaid fact, <hi>≈øci.</hi> to acquit the Pri≈øoner, but all that he can do is to re≈øpite Iudgment again≈øt the party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe of the Iudges knowing to the contrary, and to make further Relation thereof to the King for his Pardon of grace for the Party. So in our Ca≈øe, It may be that you in your private knowledge know, That the Ho≈øpital <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> and the Ho≈øpital <hi>vocat. le Savoy,</hi> is all one, but that doth not appear unto you upon the Record which is before you, but it may be for any thing that appears in the Record, that they are diver≈øe and ≈øeveral Ho≈øpitals; Therefore the Lea≈øe is void. To prove my Minor, I do ≈øay that this word <hi>(de)</hi> as here, <hi>de Savoy,</hi> de≈øignes a place, ≈øo as by this Word <hi>(de)</hi> the place is become parcel of the Name, but this word <hi>vocat. locum non denotat,</hi> but only the very name, and ≈øo here is a material difference and variance, for here by pretence of the Name in this Lea≈øe, there is not any place of the Corporation in the Name, but the Corporation is tran≈øitory, which cannot be, for a Corporation e≈øpecial con≈øi≈øting of many per≈øons, as <hi>Corpus aggregatum</hi> ought to have a certain place of their abiding, or otherwi≈øe it cannot be di≈øcerned by the Law, and it is but a Mathematical thing, and nothing el≈øe but a fiction, and they cannot be otherwi≈øe con≈øidered in Law, but as they are <hi>circum≈øcripti</hi> within the bounds of their hou≈øe, and they cannot appear but by Attorney: and if a Prebend con≈øi≈øt upon a Manor, &amp; afterwards the Manor by Writ be demanded again≈øt the Prebend, and he lo≈øe it, here he hath lo≈øt his Name, becau≈øe he hath lo≈øt that which giveth to him his Name, by Contrary by <hi>Blake,</hi> for his e≈øtate and place in the Chapter, doth remain unto him: And ≈øecondly, for another Cau≈øe here is a material variance, for this word <hi>(de)</hi> ≈øuppo≈øeth a place before the Foundation, as the place upon which the Ho≈øpital was erected was called <hi>Le Savoy</hi> before the Erection of it; but the≈øe words <hi>(vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. le Savoy)</hi> ≈øuppo≈øeth the ≈øame Name <hi>Savoy</hi> was impo≈øed upon the Foundation. Thirdly, the≈øe words <hi>(de le Savoy)</hi> do import the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53034:88"/>
Ho≈øpital to be part of the place, which before the Foundation, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Savoy,</hi> but <hi>vocat.</hi> trencheth only to all the place called <hi>Savoy:</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>(de le Savoy)</hi> is matter of certainty and verity; <hi>(vocat.)</hi> but matter of Reputation. And ≈øo for the≈øe four rea≈øons, great difference in ≈øub≈øtance appeareth betwixt the very name of the Ho≈øpital, and the Name u≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Lea≈øe. And he cited the Ca≈øe 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Wingat.</hi> King <hi>E.</hi> 4. did incorporate the Dean and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Wind≈øor,</hi> by the Name of Dean and Cannons of the King and Queens Free Chappel of Saint <hi>George</hi> the Martyr within his Ca≈øtle of <hi>Wind≈øor;</hi> and made a Lea≈øe by another Name, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Name of Dean and Cannons of the King and Queens Free Chappel there, and the ≈øame Lea≈øe was made in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and it was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that the ≈øame was a variance in Sub≈øtance. And he cited another Ca≈øe 30 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench betwixt <hi>Fi≈øher</hi> and <hi>Boys.</hi> A Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> was by Act of Parliament incorporated by the Name of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Scholars, <hi>Domus ≈øive Collegii Scholarium de Merton in univer≈øitate Oxoniae,</hi> and they make a Lea≈øe by the Name <hi>Cu≈øtos Domus ≈øive Collegii de Merton in Oxonia,</hi> and <hi>Scholares eju≈ødum Domus,</hi> and the variance in that point, becau≈øe in the very name of the Foundation, <hi>Domus five Collegii Scholarium de Merton,</hi> and in the u≈øurped Name in the Lea≈øe <hi>Domus ≈øive Collegii de Merton,</hi> was holden material, and the true name was <hi>de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in univer≈øitate Oxoniae,</hi> but in the Lea≈øe, <hi>in Oxonia</hi> only, leaving out the word Vniver≈øity, and the ≈øame was holden a variance in ≈øub≈øtance: For <hi>Oxford</hi> doth contain in it ≈øelf the Vniver≈øity, which is a thing of it ≈øelf, and al≈øo the City is a thing by it ≈øelf: and it may be that there is a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the City called <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, and al≈øo a Colledge which is called by ≈øuch Name in the Vniver≈øity: and ≈øo in our Ca≈øe, it may be that there is an Ho≈øpital which is called the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and al≈øo another which is <hi>Le Savoy,</hi> and then the Court ≈øhall be enveigled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the end of the Argument, the Lord Trea≈øurer, which was the Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> put this Ca≈øe, which was adjudged in his time. The Guild of <hi>Bo≈øton</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln≈øhire,</hi> was incorporated by the Name of the Guild of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and our Lady the Virgin <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> and they made a Lea≈øe for years by the Name of the Guild of our Lady the Virgin, and St. <hi>Nicholas, Religione quadam motus ut nomen Virginis Mariae, in charta dimi≈ø≈øionis, proponere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur nomini Sancti Nicholai;</hi> and it was adjudged a void Lea≈øe for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance afore≈øaid. And afterwards at another day, the matter was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by <hi>Atkin≈øon,</hi> on the part of the Defendant. <hi>Starkey</hi> 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 56. ≈øaith, That the Name of the Corporation, by which it is incorporated, is as properly the Name of a Corporation, as the Name of Bapti≈øm is the Name of a ≈øingle and individual per≈øon, and yet there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the mi≈øpri≈øion of them, for the Name of Bapti≈øm doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt of one word, and therefore it cannot admit of any variance, but the name of a Corporation doth con≈øi≈øt of many words: in which ca≈øe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance in words which are ≈øupplyed by other words, and not in matter of ≈øub≈øtance, ≈øhall not hurt; and that hearing is notably di≈øcu≈ø≈øed in the ca≈øe of the <hi>Cooks</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> cited before by <hi>Godfrey.</hi> Four things are to be con≈øidered in the Name of a Corporation, which are of the E≈ø≈øence and Sub≈øtance of it: Fir≈øt, the per≈øons incorporated, of which the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth con≈øi≈øt, as here the Ma≈øter and Chaplains <hi>de Savoy.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The quality of the Corporation, as Dean and Chapter, Mayor and Commonalty: Thirdly, the Patron or Founder, as, <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge; Fourthly, The Place whereupon the Corporation is founded. As to this la≈øt point, ≈øee 31 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 28. and <hi>fo.</hi> 15 by <hi>Knivet;</hi> and ≈øee 6 <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> King <hi>H.</hi> 8. erected the Dean and Prebend of <hi>Che≈øter,</hi> by the≈øe words, <hi>≈øcil. Decanus et Capit. Cathedralis Eccle≈øiae Chri≈øti, et Sanctae Mariae Virginis Ce≈øtriae.</hi> And afterwards by Letters Patents, gave to the ≈øaid Dean and Chapter, certain Manors, <hi>Decano et Capitulo Eccle≈øiae Cathedralis Chri≈øti et Sanctae Mariae Virginis,</hi> by us before erected, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53034:88"/>
that grant was holden void, becau≈øe that the place where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not expre≈ø≈øed in the ≈øaid Letters Patents, for <hi>Ce≈øtria</hi> is the local place of the Incorporation. And as to the Objection made upon the word <hi>(de)</hi> that this word <hi>(de)</hi> goeth only to part, and <hi>(vocat.)</hi> goes to the whole, and ≈øo here is a great difference; the ≈øame is not any rea≈øon, for this word <hi>(de)</hi> extends as well to the whole as to part. As a Rent granted <hi>percipiend. de Manerio de D.</hi> the ≈øame ≈øhall go to the whole Mannor, 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>ad re≈øpondendum I. Abbati Mona≈øterii Sanctae Mariae Ebor.</hi> where the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation was, <hi>Abbati Mona≈øterii Sanctae Mariae Virginis extra Muros Ebor.</hi> and yet the Writ was well enough, notwith≈øtanding ≈øuch variance, <hi>a forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori,</hi> in the ca≈øe of a conveyance and Intere≈øt. And I conceive that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the Record, That the Lea≈øe given in evidence of the part of the Defendant, is a Lea≈øe made by the Ma≈øter and Chaplains of the Ho≈øpital of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> for it is found by verdict, That King <hi>Henry the eighth,</hi> upon the Site of the Manour of <hi>Savoy,</hi> betwixt the hou≈øe of the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Worce≈øter,</hi> and the hou≈øe of the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Carli≈øle,</hi> and that it was incorporated by the Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that afterwards <hi>Q. Mary</hi> by her Letters Patents, reciting the foundation of the ≈øaid Ho≈øpital cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and lamenting the Ruin of it, being ≈øurrendred in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 6. did re≈øtore it, by which it appeareth, That the Ho≈øpital of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Ho≈øpital called the <hi>Savoy</hi> is one and the ≈øame in re≈øpect of the Bounds, Foundation, and Situation. And in the whole cour≈øe of our Books, no ca≈øe can be found, That any Corporations have avoided their own acts, by ≈øuch cau≈øe of Mi≈øno≈ømer, nor of ≈øuch matter, is any que≈øtion moved in our Books. And as to that which hath been objected, That although the Iudges in their private knowledge well know, That the Hou≈øe <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> and the Hou≈øe <hi>vocat.</hi> the <hi>Savoy,</hi> be all one, yet they ought not to judge according to ≈øuch their private knowledge, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their judicial knowledge, which they have out of the Record. I conceive, That the Iudges of nece≈ø≈øity ought to u≈øe in ≈øuch ca≈øes their private knowledge; as where Mi≈øno≈ømer of a Colledge was objected, <hi>viz. Trinity Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where it was incorporated by the Name of Ma≈øters, Fellows, and Scholars <hi>Collegii Sanctae &amp; individuae Trin.</hi> and they made a Lea≈øe by the Name of Ma≈øter, Fellows, and Scholars of the Colledge of <hi>Trinity,</hi> the ≈øame was holden a good Lea≈øe, for the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges knew well enough, That this word <hi>Trinity</hi> doth imply in it ≈øelf <hi>Sancta &amp; individua,</hi> but by what knowledge? not by their judicial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but by their private knowledge; So in our ca≈øe. <hi>Egerton</hi> the Queens Sollicitor to the contrary: It is a clear and plain Rule in our Law, That the name of a Corporation is as a name of Bapti≈øm to a natural man, and if there be any difference, I conceive, that the Law requires more ≈øtrict certainty in the name of a Corporation than in the Name of any particular per≈øon, For a name is more nece≈ø≈øary to a Corporation than to another, for when an infant is born, he is pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a perfect creature, before any name given him, and the giving of the Name is not a matter of nece≈ø≈øity, but of policy for di≈øtinction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the ca≈øe of a Corporation, The Name is the ≈øub≈øtance and e≈ø≈øence of it, and it is not a Body before a Name be impo≈øed upon it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Charters of Corporations there is always ≈øuch a clau≈øe, <hi>per tale nomen implacitare, &amp; implacitari, acquirere, &amp;c. po≈ø≈øint,</hi> and without their Name, they are but a Trunk: but contrary in the ca≈øe of particular per≈øons; Land is given <hi>primogenito filio J. S.</hi> It is a good gift, although there be no Name of Bapti≈øm: Lands given <hi>omnibus filiis J. S.</hi> is a good name of purcha≈øe, and if a man be bound in an obligation by a wrong or fal≈øe Name, and in an action brought upon the ≈øame, if it appeareth upon evidence, that he was the ≈øame per≈øon which ≈øea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and delivered it, the ≈øame is ≈øufficient, and the Bond ≈øhall bind him. But contrary in the ca≈øe of a Corporation, and we cannot give any thing to a Corporation by circum≈øtances, inducing or imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53034:89"/>
their true name. As Land given to the fir≈øt Ho≈øpital which the Queen ≈øhall found,<note place="margin">Ante. 161, 162.</note> although that it ≈øufficiently appear, That ≈øuch a one was the Ho≈øpital which the Queen fir≈øt founded, yet the gift is void: And he denied, That the four things remembred before are nece≈ø≈øarily required in the Name of a Corporation: for if the Queen will found a Corporation, as an Ho≈øpital by the Name of <hi>Utopia,</hi> the ≈øame is well enough without any re≈øpect of per≈øons, place, Founder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ≈øet forth in the Charter. And al≈øo other things be≈øides the ≈øaid four things are ≈øometimes nece≈ø≈øary in a Corporation; As if the Queen will found an Ho≈øpital by the Name, <hi>Quod fundavimus ad roga. Chri≈øt. Hatton Cancel. Angliae.</hi> all the ≈øame ought to be expre≈ø≈øed in every grant made by, or to the ≈øaid Ho≈øpital; So <hi>Quod fundavimus ad relevandum pauperes;</hi> and ≈øometimes the number of the per≈øons incorporated, if it be in the Charter, it ought to be u≈øed in all acts made by or to them; As Ma≈øter and ≈øir Chaplains; ≈øo as the ≈øaid four things recited before, are not ≈øo nece≈ø≈øary in the Name of a Corporation, but ≈øo far forth as they are parcel of the Name given to them in the Charter of the Corporation: And in our ca≈øe, 1. The place <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> is part of their name, ≈øet down in the Charter of their Corporation, and therefore the ≈øame ought to be preci≈øely follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                  <hi>Gawdy,</hi> When the Plaintiff ≈øheweth the Deed, the Defendant is chargable to arrerages due before and after the promi≈øe; wherefore if the entry maketh a ≈øu≈øpending of the Rent, the ≈øu≈øpen≈øion doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: but I conceive here is not any ≈øu≈øpen≈øion, for this promi≈øe is a meer collateral thing, and ≈øo not di≈øcharged by the entry into the Land, for it is not i≈ø≈øuing out of the Land. But if the Plaintiff before the Deed ≈øhewed had relea≈øed all Actions, the ≈øame had been a good Bar; and I conceive that the Deed was not ≈øhewed in time, for it ought to be ≈øhewn before any arrerages due after the promi≈øe, but here it is ≈øhewn five years after: But that was not denied by all ther other Iu≈øtices. Another exception was taken, that where the promi≈øe was, that if the Plaintiff ≈øhewed any Deed by which it might appear, that the Defendant ≈øhould be charged with the ≈øaid Rent, and the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, by which it might appear, that the Plaintiff ought to have the Rent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ≈øo as the Declaration doth not agree in the whole. See 1 <hi>Ma.</hi> 143. in <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Be≈øtons</hi> Ca≈øe, the Condition of the Lea≈øe was, if the Rent ≈øhould be arrear, not paid by two Months after the Fea≈øt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Rejoynder was by the ≈øpace of two months, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the pleading holden in≈øufficient, for <hi>per duos men≈øes</hi> doth not affirm directly <hi>po≈øt duos men≈øes,</hi> but by Implication and Argument: And here it was holden, that the Condition was a good con≈øideration.

And as to the la≈øt exception but one, it was re≈øolved, that the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, notwith≈øtanding the ≈øame, was good enough <hi>(≈øcil.) o≈øtendit factum per quod apparet quod redditus praedict. ≈øolvi deberet in forma praedict.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exception was taken, becau≈øe here no breach of the promi≈øe is

alledged, for it is pleaded, thath eight pounds <hi>de annuali redditu arrer. fuer.</hi> but it is not ≈øaid, <hi>de redditu praedict.</hi> 8 <hi>l. ergo</hi> it may be another Rent, and then the promi≈øe, as to this Rent, is not broken. <hi>Wray,</hi> Although the word <hi>(praedict.)</hi> be wanting, yet the Declaration is well enough, and it ≈øhall be intended the Rent mentioned before. See 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 30. <hi>b.</hi> Where <hi>(Villa We≈øt.)</hi> ≈øhall be intended <hi>Villa praedict.</hi> 19 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 1.

For if a man take the ≈øame, and do not convert, he is not guilty. And here the Defendant doth ju≈øtifie the conver≈øion, wherefore he cannot plead, Not guilty. The general i≈ø≈øue is to be taken where a man hath not any colour, but here the Defendant hath colour, becau≈øe the Corn whereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was growing upon his Land, which might enveigle the Lay people, and therefore it is ≈øafe≈øt to plead the ≈øpecial matter. But admit, that it doth amount but to the general i≈ø≈øue; yet there is not any cau≈øe of Demurrer, but the Plaintiff ought to ≈øhew the ≈øame to the Court, and pray that the general i≈ø≈øue be entred; and the Court <hi>ex officio</hi> ought to do it. <hi>Egerton,</hi> the Queens Solicitor, contrary. The Plea in Bar is not good; The Plaintiff declares of a Trover of his goods, <hi>ut de bonis ≈øuis propriis,</hi> and the Defendant pleads, That he took his own goods, which is not any an≈øwer to the Plaintiff.

tout</hi> by his Entry, and then when the Defendant doth eject him, he hath good cau≈øe of Action. And after at another day the Ca≈øe was moved, and it was agreed, That for one moyety the Infant is bound, for Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had an e≈øtate tail in a moyety, for he was I≈ø≈øue of the body of the Comi≈øor: But for the other moyety, the Fine levyed by Tenant for life, <hi>William</hi> the Father being then Tenant beyond the Sea, It was holden by <hi>Ander≈øon, Windham,</hi> and <hi>Walme≈øly,</hi> that the Infant was not barred, notwith≈øtanding the objection above≈øaid, That <hi>William</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never returned into <hi>England,</hi> and notwith≈øtanding the words of the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. And by <hi>Walme≈øley,</hi> If an infant make his claim with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in age it is ≈øufficient to avoid the Fine, and yet the ≈øaid Statute ≈øeems to appoint to him time within five years after his full age, ≈øo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the very words, a claim made before or after ≈øhould be vain, yet in Equity, although he be not compel≈øable to make his claim until the time allowed by the Statute, yet if he make it before, it is good enough. And by <hi>Ander≈øon,</hi> Although that <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Father did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, yet if he makes not his claim within five years after the death of his Father being of full age, and without any impediment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ≈øhall be barred. If in ≈øuch ca≈øe a man hath many impediments, he is not compellable to make his claim when one of the impediments is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but when they are all removed. So if the Ance≈øtor hath one of the ≈øaid impediments, and dieth before it be removed, and his Heir is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in age, or hath other impediment, he is not bound to make is claim till five years after his impediment is removed. And <hi>Somes</hi> ca≈øe cited before was holden and agreed to be good Law, for the Forfeiture may not be known unto him. And as to the objection again≈øt the Lea≈øe at Will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe it was made by an Infant, and no Rent re≈øerved upon it, nor the Lea≈øe made upon the Land, and therefore the Le≈ø≈øee ≈øhould be a Di≈ø≈øei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øor, To that it was an≈øwered, Be the Defendant a Di≈ø≈øei≈øor, or not, it is not material here, for if the Plaintiff had not title according to his Declaration, he cannot recover,<note place="margin">1 Cro. 220. 1 Cro. 438.</note> whether the Defendant hath title or not, for it is not like unto Tre≈øpa≈øs where the very po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion without other title is good, contrary in Actions again≈øt all who gave not title; but in <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> if the title of the Plaintiff be not good and ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, be the title of the Defendant good or not, he ≈øhall not recover: And afterwards Iudgment was given for the Defendant, <hi>Hill.</hi> 33. <hi>Eliz.</hi>

And as to the other Plea, the matter of the Plea is good enough, and the defect is but in the form, which becau≈øe the Plaintiff upon his Demurrer hath not ≈øhewed to the Court according to the Statute, he ≈øhall not take advantage of it, but the matter of the Plea is ≈øufficient, <hi>≈øcil.</hi> the finding, and the offer to deliver it to the Plaintiff. <hi>Ander≈øon</hi> Iu≈øtice, For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the in≈øufficiency of this Plea, the nature of the action, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53034:118"/>
the cau≈øe of it is to be con≈øidered; the nature of the action, it is an action upon the ca≈øe, the cau≈øe, the Trover, and conver≈øion; Then for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Plea his readine≈øs, to deliver it, It cannot be any an≈øwer to the Declaration of the Plaintiff: For this action is not Debt or Detinue, where the thing it ≈øelf is to be delivered, for in ≈øuch ca≈øe, the Plea had been good, but the Conver≈øion is the ≈øpecial cau≈øe of this Action, which by this is not an≈øwered, and for the other Plea, the Declaration is not an≈øwered by it. But here is ≈øome matter of ju≈øtification, for when a man comes to goods by Trover, there is not any doubt but by the Law he hath liberty to take the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of them, but he cannot abu≈øe them, kill them, or convert them to his own u≈øe, or make any profit of them, and if he do, it is great rea≈øon that he be an≈øwerable for the ≈øame, but if he lo≈øe ≈øuch goods afterwards, or they be taken from him, then he ≈øhall not be charged, for he is not bound to keep them, and ≈øo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Iudgment ought to be for the Plaintiff. <hi>Windham</hi> Iu≈øtice, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plea is good; as to the fir≈øt Plea, he confe≈ø≈øeth the conver≈øion, but hath not conveyed unto him≈øelf a ≈øufficient title to the goods by which he might ju≈øtifie the Conver≈øion, for the Plaintiff declares of a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of his own goods, and the Defendant ju≈øtifies, becau≈øe the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the goods was in a ≈øtranger who ≈øold them to him, which cannot be any good title for him without a Traver≈øe, unle≈øs he had ≈øhewed, that he bought them in an open Market, and then upon ≈øuch matter he might well have ju≈øtified the Conver≈øion. And as to the other Plea, the ≈øame is naught al≈øo, for the goods are not in demand, and their the ≈øaid Plea is not proper to ≈øay, that he is ready to deliver them, for damages only for the conver≈øion are in demand, and not the goods them≈øelves, and therefore the ≈øame is a Plea but by Argument, <hi>≈øcil.</hi> He is ready to deliver, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he hath not converted, and yet the ≈øame is not a good argument, for if a man find my Hor≈øe, and rides upon him, or hereby he becomes Lame, or otherwi≈øe by exce≈ø≈øive travel mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>u≈øeth him, ≈øo as my Hor≈øe is the wor≈øe thereby; He may be ready to deliver me my Hor≈øe, and yet this action will ly, for ≈øuch an abu≈øing of the Hor≈øe is a Conver≈øion to his own u≈øe. <hi>Periam</hi> Iu≈øtice,<note place="margin">Po≈øt. 224.</note> The latter Plea clearly is in≈øufficient, for it amounteth but to Not guilty, but for the fir≈øt Plea, he doubted of it, for fir≈øt the property is not traver≈øable, nor the knowing; but upon the general I≈ø≈øue pleaded, ≈øuch matter may be given in Evidence. And he conceived, That where a man buyes goods of one who comes to them by Trover, that he may ≈øell them, and ≈øhall not be an≈øwerable for them. And although it may be ≈øaid, that the ≈øaid matter may be given in evidence, yet it is not good to put the ≈øame to the people, but to refer the matter to the Iudgment of the Court. <hi>Walm.</hi> Iu≈øtice, The latter Plea is clearly in≈øufficient, but for the fir≈øt he doubted of it, for he conceived that the ≈øale of the goods is not a Conver≈øion. <hi>Ander≈øon,</hi> The fir≈øt Plea is, <hi>ut ≈øupra,</hi> and nothing in that is material or traver≈øable, for all the Plea may be true, and yet the Defendant is guilty, for it may be that the Defendant him≈øelf ≈øold them to the Plaintiff, or to another who ≈øold them to the Plaintiff, and that afterwards the Defendant found them, and here the Conver≈øion is confe≈ø≈øed, and not ≈øo voided by ≈øufficient ju≈øtification, and by him, the ≈øale to per≈øons unknown is no good Plea, for his ≈øale is his own Act, and it cannot be but he mu≈øt have notice of the buyers, and therefore he ought in his Plea to ≈øhew their names. <hi>Periam,</hi> Contrary to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as to the naming of the buyers, for it ≈øhould be an infinite thing for a Draper to take notice of every on who buyeth and Ell of Cloath of him.

This word <hi>(quou≈øque)</hi> is a word of Limitation, and not of Condition, and then the Remainder may well ri≈øe when the Limitation hapneth. It hath been ≈øaid, that this Remainder is contingent, and then the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is to ve≈øt upon a contingency, cannot be granted or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited before that the contingent hapneth: And he cited the Ca≈øe of <hi>14 Eliz. 314.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53034:129"/>
and the la≈øt part of the ≈øentence, and that the ≈øaid ≈øentence is in the Disjunctive appeareth by the ≈øub≈øequent words (which of the ≈øaid days or times ≈øhall fir≈øt happen) And then the return of <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> (for that fir≈øt hapned) ve≈øts the Remainder in him, and therefore the Plaintiff ought to be barred. <hi>Buckley</hi> contrary: The e≈øtate of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doth depend upon a Copulative, <hi>i.e.</hi> the return of <hi>Ambro≈øe</hi> and his full age, and both is but one Limitation; it is clear, that the fir≈øt Limitation is upon a contingent, and the remainder cannot ve≈øt until both are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.

The Defendant pleaded, That after the Lea≈øe <hi>John Grice</hi> and others by a≈ø≈øignment of <hi>He≈øter</hi> had cut down and carried away fifty loads of Wood in the ≈øaid Lands called the <hi>Dole,</hi> and ≈øo they had not left ≈øufficient Woods for his expences at <hi>Withons</hi> according to the Indenture, for which cau≈øe he took the ≈øaid twenty loads of Wood upon <hi>Withons</hi> for his expences, upon which the Plaintiff did demur in Law. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> The Plea is not good; This Plea is no more, but that ≈øufficient Wood was not left upon the <hi>Dole</hi> for his expences, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be not, yet the Defendant cannot cut Wood el≈øewhere, for he hath re≈øtrained him≈øelf by the Covenant.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53034:132"/>
Bar; but he conceived that the Declaration was not good, for here no breach of Covenant is a≈ø≈øigned, for the Covenant is in the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive, <hi>≈øcil.</hi> That the Defendant ≈øhould not take Wood without the a≈ø≈øent or a≈ø≈øignment of the Le≈ø≈øor or his A≈ø≈øigns: And the Plaintiff chargeth the Defendant with cutting of Wood without the a≈ø≈øent and a≈ø≈øignment of the Le≈ø≈øor, ≈øo he would compel us to prove more than we ought, for if he did it with their a≈ø≈øent only, or by their a≈ø≈øignment only, it is ≈øufficient; but if the Covenant had been in the copulative, both was nece≈ø≈øary: And for the nature of Copulatives he cited the Ca≈øe, where two Churchwardens bring an Action of Tre≈øpa≈øs, the Defendant pleads, That the Plaintiffs are not Churchwardens, upon which they are at I≈ø≈øue. The Iury find, That the one was Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden, and the other not, and for that the Plaintiffs could not have Iudgment, for if the one of them be not Churchwarden, then the Plaintiffs are not Churchwardens, for the copulatives ought not to be disjoyned: And he cited the ca≈øe lately ruled in the Common Pleas betwixt <hi>Ognel</hi> and <hi>Underwood</hi> concerning <hi>Crucifield Grange, A.</hi> lea≈øed unto <hi>B.</hi> certain Lands for forty years, <hi>B.</hi> lea≈øed part of the ≈øame to <hi>C.</hi> for ten years. <hi>A.</hi> grants a Rent-charge out of the Lands <hi>in tenura &amp; occupatione B.</hi> It was re≈øolved, That the Lands lea≈øed to <hi>C.</hi> ≈øhould not be charged with that Rent, for although it was <hi>in tenura B.</hi> yet it was not in his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, and both are exqui≈øite becau≈øe in the copulative: So here, the Le≈ø≈øee may cut Wood with the a≈ø≈øent of the Le≈ø≈øor without any a≈ø≈øignment. Al≈øo here, the ≈øub≈øtance of the covenant cannot charge the Defendant, for although it be in the Negative, yet it is not ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in the Negative, but doth refer unto the covenant precedent; for the words are, That the Le≈ø≈øee ≈øhall not cut Woods, <hi>aliter quam,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intent of the Indenture, where the covenant precedent is not, that the Le≈ø≈øee ≈øhall not cut Woods but in the <hi>Dole,</hi> but that the Le≈ø≈øor might cut down any Trees in the <hi>Dole</hi> leaving ≈øufficient for the Le≈ø≈øee, which covenant in it ≈øelf doth not re≈øtrain the Le≈ø≈øee to cut down any Trees in any part of the Lands demi≈øed, nor abridgeth the power which the Law giveth to him by rea≈øon of the demi≈øe. Then when this la≈øt covenant comes, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the Le≈ø≈øee will not cut, <hi>aliter,</hi> then according to the meaning of the Indenture without the a≈ø≈øent, &amp;c. the ≈øame doth not re≈øtrain him from the power which the meaning of the Indenture gives, and ≈øo no breach of covenant can be a≈ø≈øigned in this. For by virtue of the Lea≈øe, the Le≈ø≈øee of common Right may take nece≈ø≈øary Fuel upon any part of the Land lea≈øed: Al≈øo this fir≈øt covenant being in the Affirmative doth not abridge any Intere≈øt, as 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 19. The Le≈ø≈øor covenants, That the Le≈ø≈øee ≈øhall have ≈øufficient Hedge-boot by a≈ø≈øignment of the Baily. It is holden by <hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Shelley,</hi> That the Le≈ø≈øee may take it without a≈ø≈øignment, becau≈øe there are no Negative words, <hi>&amp; non aliter.</hi> So 8 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 10.

And although peradventure it appeareth here, that the meaning of the parties was, That the Le≈ø≈øee ≈øhould not cut down any Wood but in the <hi>Dole,</hi> yet fora≈ømuch as ≈øuch meaning doth not ≈øtand with the Law, it ≈øhall be rejected, as it was holden to be in the ca≈øe betwixt <hi>Benet</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> where a man ≈øei≈øed of divers Lands, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øed parcel of it called <hi>Gages,</hi> to the erecting of a School, and another parcel unto <hi>B.</hi> in fee, and all his other Lands unto one <hi>French</hi> in Fee, The devi≈øe of <hi>Gages</hi> was holden void, becau≈øe too general, for no per≈øon is named; and it was further holden, that it pa≈ø≈øed by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral devi≈øe to <hi>French,</hi> and yet that was not the meaning of the Devi≈øor: Al≈øo the Plaintiff is not A≈ø≈øignee but of parcel of the Rever≈øion, for if

that this Writ of Error was not transferred to the Queen: And that the ≈øaid Act by the words afore≈øaid could not convey to the King this po≈ø≈øibility of right, for at the time of the Attainder, the Right of the Writ of Error was in <hi>Lyonel,</hi> and <hi>Hen.</hi> during the e≈øtate tail limited to <hi>Lyonell</hi> had not to do with the Land, nor any matter concerning it: And Iudgment was given accordingly; And it was holden, That he in the Rever≈øion, or Remainder upon an E≈øtate tail might have a Writ of Error by the common Law, upon a Recovery had again≈øt Tenant in tail in Rever≈øion.</p>

It was al≈øo objected, That becau≈øe the Letter of Attorney was to enter in the Manor, and all the Lands and Tenements of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ≈øuch a Town, and to ≈øeal the Indenture of Lea≈øe in the name of the Le≈ø≈øors, and to deliver it to the Plaintiff as their Deed; now the Attorney in executing of this Warrant hath not pur≈øued it, for he hath only entred into the Lands, but it is not found that he entred into the Manor, and ≈øo the Lea≈øe is void. And it was ≈øaid by <hi>Puckering,</hi> That if I lea≈øe two Acres in two ≈øeveral Counties, rendring for the one Acre 10 <hi>s.</hi> and for the other Acre 10 <hi>s.</hi> and make a Letter of Attorney to make Livery in both; if the Attorney entreth into one Acre and makes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the ≈øame is void, for the Attorney hath not pur≈øued his authority, for peradventure I would not have lea≈øed the Acre whereof Livery is made for ≈øuch rent of 10 <hi>s.</hi> being perhaps of greater value, but with the other Acre which was of le≈ø≈øer value, and ≈øo the mi≈ø-executing of my warrant ≈øhall prejudice me. <hi>Windham,</hi> Perhaps if one entire Rent had been re≈øerved out of both Acres, it may be that by the Livery in one Acre all is void: But by <hi>Puckering,</hi> one entire Rent cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerved upon ≈øuch a Lea≈øe of two Acres in ≈øeveral Counties. <hi>Walme≈øley</hi> denied the Ca≈øe put by <hi>Puckering,</hi> for the authority is executed well enough, for it doth not appear upon the Verdict, but that the Colledge was in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion at the time of the Lea≈øe made, and then there needed not any ≈øuch Entry, but the bare ≈øealing and delivery of the Attorney is good enough. And al≈øo it doth not appear by Verdict, That the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath any Manor, and therefore it ≈øhall be ≈øo intended; and then the Ca≈øe is no other but that, A man lea≈øeth a Manor, and certain Lands in <hi>D.</hi> and makes a Letter of Attorney to make Livery of them, where he hath nothing in the Manor, and the Attorney makes Livery of the Land without medling with the Manor, the ≈øame is a good Livery, and the authority duly executed: But if it had been expre≈øly found, that the Colledge had ≈øuch a Manor there, then the Entry in the Land only, without medling with the Manor, and the Livery made accordingly, ≈øhould not be good: But yet afterwards he ≈øeemed to be of other opinion. And as to that which hath been objected, That the Lea≈øe is void to all intents and purpo≈øes, according to the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute (for by ≈øome it cannot be re≈øembled to the ca≈øe cited before, of the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfeild,</hi> that ≈øuch a Grant ≈øhould bind him and not his Succe≈ø≈øors;) for if this Grant in our Ca≈øe ≈øhall not be void pre≈øently, it ≈øhall never be void; for the Colledge never dieth no more than Dean and Chapter, Mayor and Commonalty. To that it was an≈øwered by <hi>Drew,</hi> That although there be ≈øome difference betwixt ≈øuch Corporations, and that the words of the Statute are general <hi>(void to all intents, con≈øtructions, and purpo≈øes,)</hi> yet they ≈øhall con≈øtrued according to the meaning of the makers of the Act, who≈øe ≈øcope was to provide for the Succe≈ø≈øors, and not for the pre≈øent Incumbent, and to the utter impoveri≈øhing of all Succe≈ø≈øors, without any re≈øpect to the party him≈øelf, as it appeareth by the preamble of the ≈øaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; where it is ob≈øerved, That by long and unrea≈øonable Lea≈øes, the decay of Spiritual Livings is procured; for the remedying and preventing of which long Lea≈øes this Act was made, and that the Succe≈ø≈øors ≈øhould not be bound thereby. And the≈øe Lea≈øes are not void, <hi>≈øimpliciter ≈øed ≈øecundum quid, i. e.</hi> as to the Succe≈ø≈øors: As upon the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 20.

The Error a≈ø≈øigned was, That the Exigent i≈ø≈øued forth into <hi>London</hi> and the Sheriff returned, that he had proclaimed the party <hi>de Com. in Com. quou≈øque, &amp;c.</hi> where he ought ≈øay, <hi>de Hu≈øtingo in Hu≈øtingum,</hi> and that was holden by the Court clearly to be Error; and afterwards at another day it was moved by <hi>Coke,</hi> That a man attainted of Felony could not make Executors, for he is dead in Law, and as <hi>Bracton</hi> ≈øaith, <hi>≈øolus Deus facit Haeredes &amp; homo nominat Executores,</hi> and therefore the Heir only ≈øhall have a Writ of Error: al≈øo an Executor cannot have a Writ of Error, but only upon a Iudgment given in a per≈øonal Action; but this Attainder is a thing of a higher nature: as where a Woman poy≈øoneth her Husband, the Heir ≈øhall not have an Appeal, for Murder is changed into Trea≈øon, and that offence is a thing of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ≈øo this Attainder is of a higher nature than in the per≈øonalty.

The Ca≈øe put by <hi>Catiline,</hi> If the Par≈øon, Patron and Ordinary make a Lea≈øe for years, and afterwards the Le≈ø≈øee becomes there Incumbent, the Term is not extinct, for he hath the Term in his own Right, and the inheritance in the Right of his Church, which ≈øee 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 43.

And although the Lea≈øe be not good, yet becau≈øe the matter of the ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øe is naught, although our Bar be naught, a Con≈øultation ought to
