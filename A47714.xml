         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>IN Treſpas, It was found by ſpecial verdict,<note place="margin">Cuſtom of Free-Bench.</note> That the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was ſeiſed of the Manor of <hi>B.</hi> whereof the place where is parcel, demiſed and demiſeable by Copy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that <hi>B.</hi> the Granfather of the Plaintiff was ſeiſed of the place where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to the cuſtom of the ſaid Manor, in Fee-ſimple, and that within the ſaid Manor there is this Cuſtom, That if any Copy-holder dieth ſeiſed, his Wife over-living him ſhall hold all the Land during her Widowhood as Free-bench, and ſhall be admitted Tenant to the Lord,<note place="margin">2 Brownl 21.</note> and that the Heir ſhall not be admitted to it during the life of his Mother: And found alſo another Cuſtom within the ſaid Manor, That if any Copy-holder be convicted of Felony, and the ſame be preſented by the Homage, that then the Lord might ſeize, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it was further found, that the Grandfather of the Plaintiff took a Wife, and died ſeiſed, having iſſue <hi>A.</hi> Father of the Plaintiff. The Wife is admitted to her Free-bench, <hi>A.</hi> is convicted of Felony, and that is preſented by the Homage; and afterwards <hi>A.</hi> died, after which the Wife died, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was argued by <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> that <hi>A.</hi> is not within the danger of this Cuſtom, for during the life of his Mother, who by a Claimer is Tenant to the Lord, and admitted to it, ſhe is Copy-holder; and it is not like to the Caſe lately adjudged of <hi>poſſeſſio fratris,</hi> without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, for there the party was admittable, and ſo he was not here: And alſo it appeareth by the Cuſtom as it is found, That the Lord upon ſuch matter ſhall ſeize, and therefore we ought to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction that this Cuſtom doth not extend to Caſes where the Lord cannot ſeize; but in the Caſe at Bar, the Lord cannot ſeize by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this Free-bench; And we ought not by any conſtruction to extend a Cuſtom beyond the words in which it is conceived, but it ſhall be taken ſtrictly, and not be ſupplyed by Equity with a Cuſtom in the place of a Seiſure. But notwithſtanding all this, afterwards Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given againſt the Plaintiff.</p>

The matter of challenge was many times argued, and it was argued againſt the ſaid challenge, becauſe that the King is party, againſt whom no Lord of Parliament ſhall have ſuch Prerogative. To which it was anſwered on the other ſide, that ſo much the rather the challenge lyeth in the Caſe, for where a Peer of the Parliament is to be tryed upon an Endictment of Treaſon or Felony, it ſhall be <hi>per pares;</hi> if upon appeal of Murder, or Felony by ordinary tryal, See 33. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br.</hi> Tryal 42 and <hi>Br.</hi> Enqueſt, 49.

Another matter was moved, becauſe the Endictment is <hi>(clauſum Domini Paget)</hi> and it appeareth by the Verdict, that the ſaid cloſe at the time of the Treſpaſs was in the occupation of <hi>B.</hi> at the will of the Lord <hi>Paget:</hi> for the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> cannot have an Action of Treſpaſs againſt the ſaid Biſhop, or the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> upon the matter; and by <hi>Wray,</hi> the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> cannot have Treſpaſs, <hi>Quare clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum fregit &amp; intravit</hi> upon this matter; but for digging upon the Land, demiſed, or cutting of Trees, an Action lyeth, 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Tit.</hi> Treſpaſs, 36.

But by <hi>Wray;</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the Action of Treſpaſs doth not lye for the Leſſor, yet it is well enough by way of Endictment.

                  <note place="margin">Fine for Alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Licence.</note> and ſhewed the whole matter aforeſaid, and prayed to be diſcharged. It was ſaid, that this Prerogative to have a Fine for alienation without licence, had lately beginning upon the original creation of Seignories, ſo as this prerogative is as it were paramount the Seignory, and ſhall go paramount the Condition, as well as the Condition is paramount the Alienation, but if the diſſeiſor of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the King maketh a Feoffment in Fee, now upon the entry of the diſſeiſee, the perſon of the Feoffee ſhall be charged with a Fine, but the Land by the re-entry of the diſſeiſee is diſcharged: and ſuch is the opinion of the Lord <hi>Frowick,</hi> in his Reading upon the Statute of <hi>Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gativa Regis,</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe the diſſeiſor is not Tenant to the King, and ſo when he aliens, it cannot be ſaid an Alienation by the Kings Tenant. See 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 6. If the Tenant of the King in chief ſeaſeth for life with licence, and afterwards grants the Reverſion over without licence,<note place="margin">Entry for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, what acts it ſhall defeat.</note> the Tenant for life is not bound to atturn in a <hi>Quid juris clamat;</hi> wherfore it ſeems, that if ſuch Tenant doth attorn, the King ſhall ſeize preſently. This Entry for the Condition broken is not to have ſo violent a retroſpect to the firſt livery to which the Condition was annexed, that it ſhall defeat all things mean between the Creation and the breach of the Condition, but it ſhall defeat all mean things which riſe upon the act of the party, as Rent, Dower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But charges which accrue by reaſon of Tenure, do remain, notwithſtanding the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for the Condition broken: As if ſuch a Tenant of the King ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a Feoffment in Fee upon condition, which is broken, the Feoffee dieth ſeiſed, his Heir of full age, the Feoffor re-entereth, this re-entry by force of the condition broken hath not ſo avoided the deſcent, but the King ſhall have Relief upon the ſaid deſcent, for the Relief is para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the Livery, and the condition. So if a Feoffee upon condition diſclaim in Avowry,<note place="margin">Condition ſhall not avoid an Intereſt veſted.</note> by which the Lord brings a Writ of Right <hi>Sur Diſclaimer,</hi> and hath Iudgment; the Feoffee entreth for the condition broken, the ſaid re-entry ſhall not avoid the intereſt of the Lord by the Iudgment on the Writ of Diſclaimer, but he may enter at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and it was moved by <hi>Plowden</hi> who argued for <hi>Treſham,</hi> that if the Tenant of the King, being <hi>Non Compos mentis,</hi> makes a Feoffment in Fee, and dieth, his Heir entring upon the Feoffee ſhall not pay a Fine for the Alienation of his Father, but the perſon of the Father ſhall be charged with it. And at the end of this Term, after many Arguments and Motions, Iudgment was given for the Queen, that ſhe ſhould ſeize the Land and hold the ſame for the Fine, and that ſhe ſhould not be driven to ſue the perſon of the Feoffee or Conuſee: And by <hi>Manwood</hi> chief Baron, at the Commom Law in many Manors, Tenant in

ſoccage upon every alienation ſhall pay a Fine, <hi>nomine relevii, a fortiori,</hi> in the Kings caſe, and therefore he was of opinion, That this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to have a Fine for alienation without licence is by the common Law, and not by any Statute.</p>

Prſidents were ſhewed openly in Court to that effect. And all the matter aforeſaid, was agreed by the Chancellor, Treaſurer, and the ſaid Iuſtices, and no certificate at all needs to be in the Caſe, and then a ſuperfluous Certificate being nought, ſhall not hurt: for Nugation is ſurpluſage. Another matter was to conſider, what intereſt the Queen hath in the Lands of Fugitives by the common Law; And as to that they were all clear of opinion,<note place="margin">Fugitives.</note> that the Queen in ſuch caſe as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid may ſeize, and aſſign her intereſt over: And that ſuch Aſſignees may grant Copy-holds, parcel of the Manor aſſigned, which grants ſhall bind him who cometh in after, <hi>cum manus Domini regis amoventur;</hi> and alſo when the Statutes of 13 and 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> come,<note place="margin">Dy. 375 b.</note> the Statutes do not amend the eſtate of the Queen, but the eſtate of the Queen doth continue as before, and all the Eſtates under it.

               <p>IN the Dutchy Chamber, the caſe was, that King <hi>E</hi> 6. leaſed for years certain lands parcel of his Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> rendring rent, with clauſe of re-entry, and that a leaſe was made to one <hi>Bunny;</hi> It was found by Office that the Rent was arrear, and by another Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that the Servant of the ſaid Leſſee, had tendred the rent in his abſence, and by the commandment of his Maſter, and that afterwards one <hi>I. S.</hi> Receiver General of the Dutchy, received the ſaid Rent, and had accounted for it, and upon his account it was allowed; And this matter was opened at <hi>Serjeants Inn</hi> in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet,</hi> before <hi>Wray, Anderſon, Manwood, Clench, Rhodes, Plowden,</hi> and <hi>Stanhop;</hi> and it was argued by <hi>Shut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleworth,</hi> that in this caſe of rent reſerved upon a Leaſe for years, made by the King of Dutchy-Land,<note place="margin">The King not bound to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Rent.</note> the King is not bound to demand it, but he may for default of payment of it, re-enter without demand, and that the Leſſee is tied to tender it at his peril, as well as if the Queen had been ſeiſed of the ſaid land in the right of her Crown; and as to that payment, the Statute of 1 <hi>H</hi> 4. is to be conſidered, by which it is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, that the poſſeſſions of the ſaid Dutchy <hi>Taliter, &amp; tali modo, &amp; per tales officiarios &amp; miniſtros in omnibus remaneant, deducantur, &amp; gubernentur ſicut remanere, deduci, &amp; gubernari debuiſſent, ſi ad culmen Regis Dignitatis aſſumpti non fuiſſemus,</hi> and theſe words ought to be intended of things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Lands themſelves; but this Act of demand is a perſonal thing, and concerns the perſon of the King, and toucheth the Majeſty, and dignity of the King, and in all caſes of the Dutchy the perſon of the King ſhall hold his priviledge, notwithſtanding that the poſſeſſion of the Land be carried in the courſe of a private perſon: And therefore if the Queen will alien Lands parcel of her Dutchy, ſhe ought to make Livery, for now ſhe meddles with the poſſeſſion it ſelf: but if the Queen will ſue for parcel of her Dutchy, <hi>non omittas</hi> ſhall be in the Writ, for ſhe cannot ſue but as Queen, and the Queen hath ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, that none ſhall execute her Writs at her own ſute, but the Officer of the Crown, 21 <hi>E</hi> 4. 60. for Livery, if it be not Land within the County Palatine, and for the reſidue, See 10 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 7. 3. <hi>Eliz.</hi> 216, 217. <hi>Plowden,</hi> Leſſee for years of Lands of the Dutchy, ſhall have aid of the King before Iſſue joyned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if the King make a Feoffment of Lands of his Dutchy out of the County Palatine, to hold of him in <hi>Capite,</hi> the Feoffee ſhall hold it ſo, and a Feoffment of ſuch Lands upon condition that the Feoffee ſhall not alien is a good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Lapſes ſhall not bind the Queen in caſe of an Advowſon which the Queen hath in the right of the Dutchy, and if the Villain of the Queen in the right of the Dutchy purchaſeth Lands in Fee, and aliens, yet the Queen ſhall ſeiſe, and that hath been adjudged in the Exchequer Chamber; and if the Queen make a Leaſe of ſuch Land, and afterwards makes another Leaſe of the ſame Land without reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the firſt Leaſe, it hath been adjudged that the ſecond Leaſe is void. It was argued contrary by <hi>Beamount</hi> the younger, that this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition which goeth to the realty, to reduce the Land again, ought to be ordered and governed by the Queen, as it ought to be by a Subject; and therefore, if the Queen will take advantage of this condition, ſhe ought to make a Letter of Attorney under the Dutchy Seal, to her own Officer, authorizing him thereby to make demand of the ſaid Rent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by <hi>Shuttleworth</hi> here be two Offices, the one contrary to the other, the beſt ſhall be taken for the Queen, 14 <hi>E</hi> 4. 5. in <hi>Skreens</hi> Caſe in the end of it: And if the Rent of the Kings Farmor be behind, now although that after the Receivor of the Dutchy doth receive it, yet the ſame doth not purge the forfeiture, as if the Bayliffs of a Manor receive rent of a new Feoffee, the ſame will not change the Avowry of the

And the courſe of proceeding in a Writ of Error, when Error is aſſigned out of the Record, and not of a thing within the Record, is ſuch: After Error aſſigned, before that a <hi>Sci. fac.</hi> iſſueth againſt the Defendant <hi>ad audiendum errores,</hi> the Plaintiff may pray a <hi>Certiorare</hi> to the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium,</hi> in whoſe hands ſuch collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral thing remain, for the Plea Roll doth remain in the cuſtody of the chief Iuſtice, but the Original Writs, Eſſoins and Warrants of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney remain in the hands of the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium;</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Certiorare</hi> the Court may grant to the Plaintiff, without making the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant privy to it. And notwithſtanding that the Defendant hath plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>in nullo eſt erratum,</hi> and ſo hath affirmed the Record to be ſuch as is certified, yet the Court <hi>ex Officio,</hi> ſhall award a <hi>Certiorare</hi> to aſcertain themſelves if there be any ſuch Warrant of Attorney or not: which ſee 9 <hi>E</hi> 4.<note place="margin">Certiorare.</note> 32. by <hi>Billing,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Certiorare</hi> being awarded <hi>ex Officio,</hi> ſhall not prejudice the Defendant; and to this purpoſe he cited the Caſe betwixt the Lord <hi>Norris</hi> and <hi>Braybrook</hi> in a Writ of Error, where the Lord <hi>Norris</hi> being Plaintiff prayed a <hi>Certiorare</hi> to the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium,</hi> to certifie an Original Writ, upon which a common Recovery was had, and had it, and the <hi>Cuſtos Brevium</hi> certified, that there was no Original; and afterwards the Defendant prayed another <hi>Certiorare,</hi> and had it: and ſo in our Caſe here eſpecially, becauſe the Defendant was not party to the Record, nor hath day in Court, at the time that the ſaid <hi>Certiorare</hi> was granted, for the Defendant is not party before the <hi>Sci. facias ad audiendum errore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Et hoc paratus eſt verificare.</hi> But as to that, it was ſaid by the Court, that the Demurrer was well enough, with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch Averment in the concluſion of it, which ſee oftentimes in the <hi>Commentaries, &amp;c.</hi> and in the Book of Entries 146. the greater part of the Demurrers have not any ſuch concluſion. Another Exception was taken to the bar, becauſe the Defendant pleads, that heretofore <hi>Walter Carter</hi> had brought an Aſſiſe againſt the now Plaintiff, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the Land put in view to the Recognitors of the Aſſiſe <hi>per praefatum Warrhamum Carter, &amp;c.</hi> and the Land where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is all one, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> here is <hi>Warrhamum</hi> for <hi>Walterum,</hi> and notwithſtanding that it was after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer, and not after verdict, it was adjudged amendable; and as to the matter of the bar, it was ſaid by the Defendants Council, that recovery of Lands in one Town, by <hi>Praecipe quod reddat,</hi> is not a bar for Lands in another Town; but where the recovery is by Aſſiſe it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,<note place="margin">

And therefore if a recovery in an Aſſiſe be pleaded in bar, Not compriſed, is not any Plea againſt it, as in the Caſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries upon a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat;</hi> but not put in view, and ſo not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which proves that the Record doth not guid the recovery, but the view of the Iurors.

It was ſaid on the Plaintiffs ſide, that recovery in <hi>Lee juxta Tunbridge</hi> could not extend to Lands in <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> no more than a recovery of Lands in one County can extend to Lands in another County: See 23 <hi>E</hi> 3. 16.

See alſo 16 <hi>E</hi> 3. 16. in an Aſſiſe of Tenements in <hi>W.</hi> the Tenant pleads a Recovery of the ſame Lands agaiſt one <hi>A.</hi> by Aſſiſe brought of Tenements in <hi>C.</hi> which was found by the Aſſiſe, and that <hi>C.</hi> is a Hamlet of <hi>W.</hi> and the Plaintiff notwithſtanding that recovery ſo pleaded had Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for a recovery of Lands in one Town ſhall not be a bar in an Aſſiſe of Lands in another Town. See <hi>Br. Tit.</hi> Iudgment 66. 10 <hi>E</hi> 3. And the whole Court was clear of opinion, that the plea in bar was not good, for in the Aſſiſe which is pleaded in bar in the principal Caſe, the Tenant there, who is now Plaintiff in this Action of Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, pleaded <hi>Nul tort nul diſſeiſin,</hi> which is no plea, as to the Free-hold in <hi>Lee juxta Tunbridge,</hi> and therefore it cannot be like to the Caſe which hath been put of 26 <hi>E</hi> 3. for there the Tenant pleaded, that he held

the ſaid Lands put in view joyntly, for there he agreeth with the Plaintiff in the Lands demanded, the which Lands are put in view; but if in the Caſe at bar the Defendant being Plaintiff in the Aſſiſe, the now Plaintiff being then Tenant, had pleaded to the Land put in view in bar, and the Plaintiff in the Aſſiſe had recovered, now in this Action of Treſpaſs the Plantiff in the Aſſiſe being Defendant in the Action of Treſpaſs, might well plead this Recovery in bar, for by his plea in the Aſſiſe he hath tyed himſelf to the view, and to the Land put in view, but it is not ſo in the Caſe at Bar, where the Tenant in the Aſſiſe pleads, <hi>nul tort, nul diſſeiſin,</hi> for there he doth not plead expreſly to the Land put in view, but to the ſuppoſal of the Plaintiff, <hi>ſc. de libero te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemento in Lee juxta Tunbridge:</hi> afterwards <hi>Wray,</hi> with the aſſent of the other Iuſtices awarded, that the Plaintiff ſhould recover his dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: See by <hi>Wray,</hi> 44 <hi>E</hi> 3. 45. in Aſſiſe of Tenements in <hi>B.</hi> the Plaintiff pleads, that he himſelf brought an Aſſiſe of the ſame Tenements, and his plaint was of Tenements in <hi>E.</hi> and the ſame Tenements put in view, and recovered, and holden a good Plea, becauſe the Tenant hath ſaid, that the ſame Tenements were put in view, and that took by Aſſiſe, upon which the Plaintiff ſaid, not put in view, and ſo not compriſed.</p>

They that have argued in this caſe at the Bar, have ſtood much upon the words of the Conveyance, <hi>manerium ſuum de North-kelſey,</hi> and that Sir <hi>Fr. Askew</hi> at the time of that aſſurance, had not any Manor of <hi>North-kelſey,</hi> or in <hi>North-kelſey,</hi> but that is not any reaſon, for if <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> (mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Statute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8.) will make a Feoffment of the Manor which was in uſe, by theſe words, <hi>manerium ſuum,</hi> the ſame had been good, and yet it is not <hi>manerium ſuum,</hi> but the Manor of the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees, but it may be ſaid <hi>ſuum,</hi> by receiving of the profits according to the truſt and confidence repoſed in the Feoffees; ſo in our caſe, in as much as Sir <hi>Fr. Askew</hi> had before this grant aſwell demeſnes as ſervices in <hi>North-kelſey,</hi> it may collaterally be ſaid a Manor there, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that <hi>tempore conceſſionis (proprie loquendo)</hi> no Manor was in <hi>North-kelſey,</hi> yet now upon operation of the Law, upon this grant a new Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor ſhall riſe, for in divers caſes where a thing which was not in <hi>eſſe</hi> before, upon a grant may riſe; As if I grant unto you out of my Land a Rent <hi>de novo;</hi> And alſo a thing which was not in <hi>eſſe</hi> before, may upon a grant take upon it a new nature; As if <hi>I.</hi> ſeiſed of a great Wood, grant to you Eſtovers out of it, they were not before in me but as Woods and Trees, now by this grant they are become Eſtovers in the Grantee, ſo as they are in the Grantee in another nature, than they were in me: So in our caſe, although <hi>North-kelſey</hi> was not a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in Sir <hi>Fr. Askew,</hi> yet now upon the grant it is a Manor in <hi>Bard,</hi> 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 17. And as to the matter which hath been objected, becauſe a Court cannot now begin, the ſame is not any reaſon, for the Court Baron is incident to the Manor, and alſo to every part of the Manor, and tranſitory through the whole Manor, and if Sir <hi>Fr. Askew</hi> had ſold all the demſnes of the Manor in <hi>Caſtord,</hi> where the Court Baron for the ſaid Manor had always been held and not elſe-where, yet ſuch a Court might be holden in any part of the Demeans in any other of the ſaid Towns: The Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, It hath been argued of the other ſide, that the Manor doth not paſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the grant is in theſe words, <hi>manerium de North-kelſey,</hi> in <hi>North-kelſey,</hi> I conceive that theſe words, <hi>(de North-kelſey)</hi> are void, as matter of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage, and the grant ſhall be conſtrued as if the words had been <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerium ſuum</hi> in <hi>North-kelſey:</hi> And a Manor is ſuch a thing, as may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, divided, and ſuſpended: As if the Lord of a Manor leaſeth for years all the Demeans of the Manor, the Manor is ſuſpended du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53034:20"/>
the term for years, as lately it hath been adjudged. And a warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be divided, as if a Feoffment in Fee be made to two with war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranty, and the one of them releaſeth the warranty: <hi>vide L.</hi> 5. <hi>E.</hi> 4. 103. <hi>A.</hi> ſeiſed of a Manor which extendeth in four Towns, <hi>B. C. D.</hi> and <hi>E.</hi> and he gives his Manor in <hi>B. C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> by this gift the Manor and all that is in the ſaid four Towns paſſeth. And he cited alſo a Caſe 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 3. The Lord of a Manor erected a Chapel within his ſaid Manor as a Chapel of Caſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and afterwards it is a Pariſh-Church, now it is become preſentable; an Advowſon appendant, as the ſoil upon the which the Church is built is parcel of the Manor. See 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 9. One Manor may be parcel of another Manor, as <hi>A.</hi> holdeth of <hi>B.</hi> twenty acres of Land, as of his Manor of <hi>C.</hi> which Manor <hi>B.</hi> holdeth of <hi>D.</hi> as of his Manor of <hi>E. B.</hi> dieth without Heir, ſo as his Manor of <hi>C.</hi> is eſcheated unto <hi>D.</hi> now the twenty acres are holden of the Manor of <hi>C.</hi> as they were before, and the Manor of <hi>C.</hi> is by the Eſcheat become parcel of the Manor of <hi>E.</hi> and by Leaſe of the Manor of <hi>E.</hi> it ſhall paſs.<note place="margin">Poſt. 32.</note> And I do not know any difference between the Caſe of Parce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and the Caſe of Ioynt-tenants, for now they are both equally compellable to make partition: And he cited the Caſe of one <hi>Eſtopp.</hi> lately adjudged, <hi>viz.</hi> the Queen was ſeiſed of the Rectory of <hi>D.</hi> which extended into the Counties of <hi>Lincoln</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> and the Queen grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her Rectory of <hi>D.</hi> in <hi>Lincoln,</hi> theſe are ſeveral grants, and now upon the matter they are become ſeveral Rectories. And as to that which hath been objected concerning a Court Baron which ought to belong to this new Manor, and that ſuch a Court cannot now at this day be erected, and therfore here cannot be a Manor; here needs not the erecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any new Court, but foraſmuch as the Court Baron before this grant might be by Law holden in any place within the Manor: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every part of the Demeans of the Manor is capable of a Court to be holden there. As where one is ſeiſed of a Manor to which an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon is appendant, now is the Advowſon appendant not only to the ſaid Manor, but to every part of it; for if he alien an acre, parcel of the Manor with the Advowſon, the Advowſon is now appendant to the ſaid acre: See 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 26. So in the Caſe at Bar, becauſe this liberty and franchiſe of a Manor is throughout the whole Manor, and in every part of the Services and Demeſnes upon this grant of the Services and Demeſnes in <hi>North-kelſey,</hi> and of his Manor in <hi>North-kelſey,</hi> a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor paſſeth; which <hi>Windham</hi> alſo granted and agreed unto. Note at this time there were but three Iudges in this Court: And afterwards Iudgment was given for the Defendant.</p>

of the ſaid Aſſurance was bounden in a Recognizance of ſix hundred pounds to one <hi>More,</hi> 15. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and afterwards <hi>More</hi> 16 <hi>Eliz.</hi> ſued a <hi>Sci. fac.</hi> upon the ſaid Recognizance; and 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the bargain and ſale afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid was made; and afterwards 19 <hi>Eliz.

But afterwards by a private Act it was done, by which it is enacted, That the Biſhop of <hi>Wales</hi> ſhould procure the Epiſtles and Goſpels to be tranſlated, and read in the Welſh Language, which matter our Preſentee might do by a Curate well enough: And he conceived, that by divers Statutes, Aliens by the Common Law were capable of Benefices. See the Statute of 7 <hi>H</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>H</hi> 5 <hi>Cap.</hi> 7. 14 <hi>H</hi> 6. <hi>Cap.</hi> 6. and before the ſaid laſt Statute Iriſh-men were capable of Benefices. <hi>Gawdy</hi> Serjeant contrary: and he confeſſed, that at the Common Law the defects aforeſaid were not any cauſes of refuſal; but now by reaſon of a private Act made, 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Entituled, An Act made for the tranſlating of the Bible, and of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service into the Welſh tongue, the ſame defect is become a good cauſe of refuſal; in which Act the miſchief is recited, <hi>viz.</hi> That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Wales</hi> did not underſtand the Language of <hi>England,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was Enacted, That the Biſhops of <hi>Wales</hi> ſhould procure ſo many of the Bibles and Books of Common Prayer to be imprinted in the Welſh Language, as there are Pariſhes and Cathedral Churches in <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſo upon this Statute, this imperfection is become a good cauſe of refuſal. And he likened it to the Caſe of Coparceners and Ioynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,<note place="margin">Ante 28.</note> who now, becauſe that by the Statute of 32 <hi>H</hi> 8. Ioynt-tenants are equally capable to make partition as Coparceners were by the Common Law; Now Partition betwixt Ioynt-tenants within age is as ſtrong as betwixt Parceners within age. But as to that point it was ſaid by the Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> that it is very true, that upon the ſaid Statute the want of the Welſh Language in the Preſentee is now become a good cauſe of refuſal; but becauſe the ſaid Act being a private Act hath not been pleaded by the Defendant, we ought not to give our Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to that Act, but according to the Common Law. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter was moved, becauſe here appeareth no ſufficient notice given to the Patron after the ſaid Refuſal, for the Plaintiff did preſent the thirtenth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> (the Church voyding the fourteenth of <hi>March</hi> before) the nine and twentieth of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the ſix months expired; the fourth of <hi>September</hi> the Defendant gave notice to the Patron of the refuſal, and the fourteenth of <hi>September</hi> was the Collation; and it was ſaid by the Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> that it appeareth here, that there are two and twenty days between the Preſentment and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which is too large a delay: And the Defendant hath not ſhewed in his Plea any cauſe for the juſtifying or excuſe of it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:53034:22"/>
and therefore upon his own ſhewing we adjudge him to be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turber: See 14 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 22. 15 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. and note by <hi>Periam,</hi> it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in the Caſe of <hi>Mollineux,</hi> if the Patron preſent, and the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary doth refuſe, he ought to give notice to the perſon of the Patron thereof, if he be reſident within the County, and if not, at the Church it ſelf, which is void.</p>

the words of our Act are, <hi>Dimiſſiones facere pro termino</hi> 21. <hi>annorum,</hi> that ſhall be meant to begin preſently: As if I leaſe to you my Lands for one and twenty years, it ſhall be intended to begin preſently; and he cited the Caſe betwixt <hi>Fox</hi> and <hi>Collier</hi> upon the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> cencerning Leaſes made by Biſhops: That four years of a former Leaſe being in being, the Biſhop leaſed for one and twenty years, the ſame was a good leaſe, notwithſtanding the former leaſe, for the leaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan preſently betwixt the parties.

                  <hi>WOod</hi> brought a Replevin againſt <hi>Humfrey Foſter</hi> and others; and made his plaint of the taking of one thouſand Cattle; <hi>Foſter</hi> pleaded, <hi>Non cepit,</hi> and the others, that the property was in another; upon which matters they were at iſſue. And as unto the firſt iſſue, the Caſe upon the Evidence was: that the late Lord <hi>Windſore</hi> was poſſeſſed of certain Sheep, and by his Will deviſed them unto <hi>Eliz.</hi> his Daughter for her advancement in marriage, and of his Will made his Wife his Executrix, and died, his Wife took to her Husband one <hi>Puttenham,</hi> who being thus poſſeſſed leaſed the ſaid Sheep with a Farm for eleven years by Indenture, upon which it was agreed between the ſaid parties, that the Leſſee ſhould keep ſo much of the Rent reſerved upon the ſaid Leaſe, to buy therewith ſo many Cattle over, ſo as the whole ſtock of the ſaid Sheep upon the ſaid Farm ſhould amount to the number of one thouſand Cattle; and the Leſſee alſo covenanted to yeild and render to the ſaid <hi>Puttenham</hi> at the end of the ſaid Term one thouſand Sheep between two years ſhorne, and four years ſhorne. Afterwards <hi>Puttenham</hi> by his deed gave unto one <hi>A.</hi> who had married the ſaid <hi>Eliz.</hi> the ſaid one thouſand Cattle, to have them after the ſaid Term; the Term expired; <hi>Puttenham</hi> ſold and granted them unto <hi>Wood,</hi> who brought them away with him. And the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> pretending that the ſaid Sheep paſſed to him by the ſaid grant of <hi>Puttenham</hi> during the ſaid Term, ſeiſed them, and the ſame was <hi>noctanter</hi> as they were driven in the high-way, <hi>unde magna contentio orta ſuit</hi> between the ſaid parties, the one charging the other with felony, whereupon the Conſtable of the Town where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuppoſing the ſaid matter would grow to an Outrage, ſeiſed the ſaid Cattle as felons goods, and afterwards went to the houſe of the ſaid <hi>Foſter,</hi> which was near unto the high-way, and asked his adviſe upon the matter, but he would not meddle therewith: Afterwards one <hi>Perkins,</hi> who had bought the ſaid Cattle of the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> came to <hi>Foſter,</hi> and ſhewed to him, that the high-ways there were not ſufficient for paſturage of the ſaid Cattle until the ſaid controverſy be determined, and prayed that the Cattle be delivered to him the ſaid <hi>Perkins</hi> to keep in the mean time; to whom <hi>Foſter</hi> anſwered, that if the ſaid <hi>Perkins</hi> would find ſufficient ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to deliver back the Cattle to him who had right, that he would be content the ſaid <hi>Perkins</hi> ſhould take them; whereupon the ſaid <hi>Perkins</hi> was bound to <hi>Foſter</hi> to that purpoſe, and took away with him the ſaid Cattle; And it was alſo given in Evidence, that the ſervants of the ſaid <hi>Foſter</hi> had ſeiſed the Cattle for the uſe of their Maſter. And by the clear opinion of the Court upon the whole matter ſhewed, <hi>Foſter non cepit,</hi> and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch direction of the Court the Iury found, that <hi>Foſter non cepit;</hi> and as to the matter of property, the Court was clear of opinion, that the grant made by <hi>Puttenham</hi> of the ſaid Cattle, during the Term, was utterly void, for <hi>Puttenham</hi> during the ſame Term had not in the ſaid Cattle either a general or a ſpecial property, nor alſo after the Term; but if after the Term expired the Leſſee will not according to his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant deliver to <hi>Puttenham</hi> one thouſand Sheep, then <hi>Puttenham</hi> is put to his Action of covenant, for here the Leſſee was bound to deliver to <hi>Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenham</hi> at the end of the Term, not the ſame Cattle which were leaſed, but ſuch a number of Sheep, and the ſame ought to be between two years ſhorne, and four years ſhorne, which could not be the Sheep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, for they did exceed ſuch degree before the end of the ſaid term, &amp; then the grant of <hi>Puttenham</hi> during the Term is meerly void: And then when after the Term, the Leſſee, according to the covenant, delivered to <hi>Wood</hi> one thouſand Sheep, he might well ſell them to the Plaintiff;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53034:27"/>
And ſuch was the opinion of the whole Court; and it was ſaid by Iuſtice <hi>Windham,</hi> that if I let certain Sheep to one for two years,<note place="margin">Property.</note> now upon that Leaſe ſomewhat remains in me, but that cannot be properly ſaid a Property, but rather the poſſibility of a Property which cannot be granted over. See 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 177. 178. 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 10. 11. In the ſame plea it was alſo holden, that in a Replevin where the plaint is of one thouſand Beaſts, and the Defendant juſtifies by reaſon of property, upon which the parties are at iſſue; Now upon the Evidence the Defendant may ſurmiſe a leſſer number of Beaſts, and drive the Plaintiff to prove a greater number than that which the Defendant hath confeſſed upon the Evidence; Notwithſtanding that the number ſet down in the plaint be by the plea of the Defendant <hi>quodam modo</hi> admitted, and the leſſer number ſurmiſed, and the contrary not proved ſhall go in mitigation of the damages, and the Iury ſhall conform their verdict in the right of damages, according to the proof of the number, notwithſtanding that the number ſet forth in the plaint be not by the Plea denied by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, and ſo it was put in ure in this Caſe: for the Plaint was of the taking of one thouſand Cattle, but the proof extended but to eight hundred ſixty five. Note alſo in the ſame Plea it was holden, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as one <hi>Chock</hi> was returned upon ſeveral Iuries in two ſeveral Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and both the Iuries are adjourned to one day; now in which of the ſaid two Courts the ſaid <hi>Chock</hi> was ſworn, he ſhall be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of his attendance at the other Court the ſame day.</p>

It was argued by Serjeant <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> that the Replication to the Bar to the avowry is not good, for in the Bar to the Avowry, the Plaintiff hath ſhewed, that he hath common in ſix Acres, and the ſame ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended common in ſix acres only, for common in forty acres cannot be the common in ſix acres; as 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 38.

For before the ſaid Statute the Incumbent could not plead any matter which did trench to the right of the Patronage, and therefore we ought not to preſume that the common Law was ſo unreaſonable to give an Action againſt a ſingular perſon, who could not by the Law ſhew and defend his own right, nor traverſe the right of the other party: And as to the plea here, he conceived that the ſame plea which the Patron might have now after the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. the Incumbent ſhall have; but he who is only a diſturber not in by preſentment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall not plead any matter but in diſcharge or excuſe of the diſturbance, 47 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 8. The King in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> counted, That King <hi>H.</hi> was ſeiſed, and preſented one <hi>A.</hi> King <hi>H.</hi> died, and the Advowſon deſcended to King <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>A.</hi> died, the now King preſented <hi>B.</hi> and now <hi>B.</hi> is dead, ſo it belongs to the King to preſent; that the Defendant being Incumbent traverſed the inſtitution and induction of <hi>B.</hi> without making title to himſelf. So 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 19. in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> the King declared that he himſelf was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and preſented one <hi>B.</hi> who at his preſentment was received, <hi>&amp;c. B.</hi> died, by which it belonged to the King to preſent; to which the Defendant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Incumbent pleaded, that the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> is yet alive, and that plea was allowed without other title made to himſelf. Note, that at the firſt Argument of this caſe, that the Court was of opinion againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant, becauſe he had not in his plea any intereſt in the Advowſon; and by <hi>Periam</hi> the Patron himſelf could not have had ſuch plea if he had been party to the Writ, therefore not the Incumbent; and it is no good pleading in any Action, to diſcover in pleading any wrong, as force, diſſeiſin, uſurpation. But at length, <hi>Mutata opinione,</hi> all the Iuſtices were agreed, that Iudgment ſhould be given againſt the Queen: And the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> ſhewed openly the reaſon of their Iudgment, for here is not bare uſurpation pleaded againſt the Queen, but alſo an eſtate, <hi>ſcil.</hi> a Leaſe for years in the ſaid Advowſon derived from Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and that the Avoidance upon which the Action is brought falleth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſaid Term, ſo as the Queen who is Plaintiff is encountred with the Leaſe of her Anceſtor, againſt which ſhe cannot make title to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, without ſpecial matter; wherefore Iudgment was given againſt the Queen.</p>

Rep. 12. b.</note>SIr <hi>Roger Lewknor</hi> ſeiſed of the Manor of <hi>Wallingford,</hi> leaſed the ſame to <hi>A.</hi> for years, and died, after which it was Enacted by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, That the ſaid Manor ſhould from henceforth be deemed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted in the Heirs of the body of the ſaid Sir <hi>Roger,</hi> begotten upon <hi>Eliz.</hi> his Wife, the ſaid Sir <hi>Roger</hi> having three Daughters only, without any other iſſue: The Daughters married Husbands and had iſſue: <hi>A.</hi> aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his entereſt in the ſaid Manor to <hi>B. C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> and alſo to one <hi>Shelley; B.C.</hi> and <hi>D.</hi> aſſigned their intereſt to one <hi>Sponer,</hi> one of the Defendants, and <hi>Shelly</hi> aſſigned his fourth part to <hi>Ford</hi> another of the Defendants, excepting the Woods and Vnderwoods. Waſt is committed; one of the Daughters having iſſue dieth, living her Husband, the two ſurviving Siſters and their Husbands, the Term being expired, brought a Writ of Waſt, leaving out the Husband of the third Siſter, who was Tenant by the Curteſy, againſt <hi>Shelley</hi> and <hi>Sponer,</hi> who <hi>Tenuerunt. Shuttleworth</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant took Exception to the Writ: <hi>ſcil. praedictus Rogerus cujus haeredes ipſae funt,</hi> which ſhall be intended Heirs general, and by the Declaration it appeareth, that the Daughters have to them by Act of Parliament an eſpecial inheritance as Heirs in ſpecial tail, and that by a ſpecial convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and therefore the Plaintiffs ought to have brought a ſpecial Writ, according to their Caſe, as where <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> maketh a leaſe for years by the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. and the Leſſee committeth Waſt, now the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees ought to have a ſpecial Writ of Waſt, according to their Caſe, 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. but that exception was diſallowed, and the caſe cited out of 6 <hi>H.</hi> 8. is upon another reaſon, for in ſuch caſe the eſtate of the Leſſee for years is created by the ſaid Statute. Another Exception was taken to the Writ, for the Writ is <hi>tenuerunt,</hi> which ſhall be intended <hi>prima facie, conjunctim tenuerunt,</hi> and in the Declaration it appeareth, that one of the Defendants is aſſignee of three parts of the Lands demiſed, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Defendant of the fourth part, and ſo <hi>ſeparatim tenuerunt,</hi> but that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was alſo diſallowed, becauſe originally it was one and intirely demiſed intereſt and eſtate, and ſo it remaineth as to the Plaintiffs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be deviſed by the Leſſee himſelf. Another Exception was taken to the Writ, becauſe here it appears upon the Plaintiffs ſhewing, that Sir <hi>Roger Lewknor</hi> had three Daughters, and that they have all taken Husbands, and that they have iſſue, and that one of the ſaid Daughters is dead, living her Husband, who is not named in the Writ, for which cauſe the Writ ſhall abate: See 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 24, 25. But that Exception was alſo diſallowed; for as this Caſe is, there is not any reaſon, that the Tenant by the Curteſy ſhould joyn in this Action, for no judgment ſhall be given here, that the Plaintiffs ſhall recover the place waſted, for the term is expired, as it appeareth by the words of the Writ, <hi>ſcil. quas tenuerunt,</hi> and the Tenant by the curteſy is in poſſeſſion, and where Tenant by the curteſie and the Heir joyn in an Action of Waſt, Tenant for life ſhall have <hi>Locum vaſtatum,</hi> and the Heir the damages, which ſee 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. As unto the matter of Law, upon the Exceptions of Woods and Vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woods, it was argued by <hi>Shuttleworth,</hi> that the Action of Waſt was not well brought againſt <hi>Ford, &amp;c.</hi> for the Aſſignment made by <hi>Shelley</hi> to <hi>Ford</hi> was with an exception of all Woods and Vnderwoods, and therefore <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> remained Tenant, and he ought to anſwer for the Wood and the Vnderwood in the Action of Waſt, for upon every demiſe of Lands the Woods there growing are as well demiſed as the Land it ſelf, for ſo it appeareth by the Writ of Waſt <hi>in domibus &amp; boſcis dimiſſis ad terminum annorum, &amp;c.</hi> which proves, that the Trees are parcel of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:53034:30"/>
the demiſe, and ſo may be execepted: See <hi>Dyer</hi> 28 <hi>H</hi> 8. 19. by <hi>Shelley</hi> and <hi>Baldwin.</hi> A man leaſeth a Manor, except <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Underwoods,</hi> the Leſſee cuts the Trees, an Action of Waſt doth not lie againſt him for the ſame, for the thing in which the Waſt is ſuppoſed to be committed was not demiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and therefore the Leſſee ſhall be puniſhed as a Treſpaſſor and not as Farmer: <hi>Fenner</hi> Serjeant contrary, and that the Exception of the Woods and Vnderwoods is meerly void; for <hi>Shelley</hi> who aſſigns his intereſt with the ſaid Exception, hath not any ſuch intereſt in the Woods and Vnderwoods, ſo as he can make ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for he had but an ordinary intereſt in them as Farmer, <hi>viz.</hi> Houſe-boot, Hedge-boot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which intereſt cannot by any means up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an Aſſignment be reſerved to the Aſſignor, in groſs of the eſtate, no more than if one hath common appendant to his Land, and he will make a Feoffment of the Land, reſerving, or excepting the common. And he who hath the inheritance of the Land, hath an abſolute proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Trees, but the Leſſee hath but a qualified intereſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 21 <hi>H</hi> 6. 46. the Leſſor during the term for years may command the Trees to be cut down: and 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 3. Leſſee for years hath not any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the Trees, but for the loppings, and for the ſhadow for his Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: And in the Caſe cited, where Leſſee for life and he in the Reverſion make a Leaſe for life unto a ſtranger, and waſt is committed,<note place="margin">Co. 1 Inſt. 42. 2.</note> and they bring an Action of Waſt, the Leſſee for life ſhall have the place waſted, and he in the Reverſion the treble damages, for in him was the true and very property of the Trees, and therefore the treble damages do belong unto him, and not to the Leſſee for life, who joyneth with him; and the reaſon wherefore the Leſſee for life or years ſhall recover tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble damages againſt a ſtranger who cuts down any Trees growing upon the Land to him demiſed, is not in reſpect of any property that the Leſſee hath in the Trees cut down, but becauſe he is chargable o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to his Leſſor in an Action of Waſt, in which he ſhall render dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in ſuch proportion. So ſee 27 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Waſt.</hi> 8. A leaſe for life is made without impeachment of waſt, a ſtranger of his own wrong cuts down Trees, againſt whom the Leſſee brings an Action of Treſpaſs; in ſuch Caſe he ſhall not recover treble damages, not for the Trees, but only for the breaking of the Cloſe, and the loppings, for he is not chargea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble over to his Leſſor for the ſame, becauſe that his Leaſe was made without impeachment of Waſt; and if the Leſſee hath ſuch a ſlender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the Trees where his Leaſe is without impeachment of waſt, his intereſt is leſs, where it is an ordinary leaſe without any ſuch privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: And the property which the Leſſee for years hath in the Trees in ſuch Caſe, is ſo appropriated to the poſſeſſion, that it cannot be ſevered from it. <hi>Windham</hi> and <hi>Anderſon</hi> Iuſtices were of opinion, that the Exception above is meerly void: For <hi>Ford</hi> the Aſſignee of <hi>Shelly</hi> is now Termer and Farmer, who alone can challenge intereſt in the Trees againſt all but the Leſſor, and <hi>Shelley</hi> after his Aſſignment, is meerly a ſtranger. The intereſt of the Leſſee, and alſo of his Aſſignee in the Trees is of neceſſity, and follows the Farm and the Land as the ſhadow doth the body; And by him, where Leſſee for years by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his leaſe is to have Wind-fals, yet he cannot imploy them but to the benefit and profit of his Farm, for if he ſell them or ſpend them elſewhere he ſhall be puniſhed. <hi>Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Periam</hi> Iuſtices, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception is good, as the fruits of the Trees, Shovelers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Caſe was adjudged upon another point in the pleading, ſo as the matter in Law did not come to Iudgment: See <hi>Saunders</hi> Caſe. 41 <hi>Eliz.</hi> Where Leſſee doth aſſign, excepting the Timber Trees, it is a void Exception.</p>

Four Exceptions have been taken to the bar: Firſt, becauſe it is not ſhewed in the bar that the moyety of thoſe ſixty meſſuages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which he pleads the Fine, was parcel of the Manor at the time of the Fine levyed; for the pleading is, that the Grandfather of the Demandant was ſeiſed of the ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, <hi>unde medietas praedictorum</hi> 60. <hi>meſſuagiorum, &amp;c. a tempore cujus contrar. me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moria, &amp;c.</hi> was parcel, and ſo ſeiſed <hi>de manerio praedict. unde, &amp;c. Finis ſe leva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit;</hi> and he conceived that the pleading, notwithſtanding that was good enough; for he hath ſaid as much in effect, <hi>contrar. cujus memoria homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num non exiſtit,</hi> in the preſent tenſe, which amounts to this, that men cannot remember, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that this moyety was parcel of the ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: As 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7 12. In an Aſſiſe of Common, the Plaintiff makes his title, that he was ſeiſed of a Meſſuage and Carve of Land in <hi>D.</hi> to which the ſaid Common is appendant, and that he and all his Anceſtors, and all thoſe whoſe eſtate he hath, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have uſed to have Common, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Exception was taken to the title, becauſe the Plaintiff doth not ſhew in his title, that he is ſeiſed of a Meſſuage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for if he hath aliened the Meſſuage the Common paſſeth, ſo if he be diſſeiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not allowed, for it appeareth upon the words of the title, that the Plaintiff is ſeiſed: <hi>i.</hi> all thoſe whoſe eſtate he hath in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent tenſe, which words do ſhew and declare poſſeſſion and ſeiſin in the Plaintiff, the time of the plea pleaded; ſo in this caſe, the ſubſtance of the words, in which the defect is aſſigned, is <hi>ut ſupra;</hi> That men cannot remember, but that this moyety was parcel of the Manor, and then the words after, <hi>unde, &amp;c. reddidit Manerium praedict. unde, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall have the ſame conſtruction as before. <hi>Periam</hi> conceived, that the Bar is nought for the cauſe aforeſaid, for it is not ſo pleaded, that we can adjudge upon it, that the ſaid moyety was parcel of the Manor at the time of the Fine levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and then the Fine cannot extend unto it. And the reaſon alledged by my brother <hi>Rhodes</hi> ſhall not help that matter, for the ſaid words can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſtrued otherwiſe, but that no man can remember but the ſaid moyety was parcel, but not that it is parcel, or at the time of the Fine levyed was parcel. <hi>Vide</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 24. In Treſpaſs the Defendant pleaded, That <hi>A.</hi> was ſeiſed of the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> whereof the place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is parcel, he ought to ſay expreſly, that the place where was parcel of the Manor at the time of the treſpaſs ſuppoſed. <hi>Windham</hi> conceived, that the plea was good, and that it appeareth well upon this plea, that the ſaid moyety was parcel of the ſaid Manor at the time of the Fine levyed, for he pleads, that the Grandfather of the Demandant was ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Manor of <hi>N. Unde medietas praedictorum, &amp;c. a tempore cujus contrar. memoria hominum non exiſtit, &amp; ſic ſciſitus exiſtens, Finis ſe levavit; ſic ſciſitus; i. e.</hi> ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the Manor in ſuch ſort, as the Manor is ſet forth before, and that is good pleading, eſpecially by way of bar, which if it be good to a common intent, is well enough; and the word <hi>(unde, &amp;c.)</hi> ſo often repeated after ſhall be idle and to no purpoſe if the Law ſhall not give ſuch a conſtruction. <hi>Anderſon</hi> to the ſame purpoſe. And he much
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:53034:45"/>
relyed upon the reaſon of <hi>Windham,</hi> and ſo ſeiſed. Another Exception was taken to the Bar,<note place="margin">Averrment.</note> becauſe in pleading of the Fine, it is not averred, that the Conuſor at the time of the Fine levyed was of full age, out of priſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as to that <hi>Rhodes</hi> took the difference between the plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Statute of 1 <hi>H.</hi> 3. where theſe diſabilities are within the purview of the ſaid Statute, and upon the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. where in the body of the Statute no mention is made of them, but afterwards in an eſpecial Exception by it ſelf; and he cited the opinion of the Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, eſpecially of the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> in the Caſe reported by <hi>Plowd.</hi> 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 365. betwixt <hi>Stowel</hi> and the Lord <hi>Zouch. Periam</hi> to the ſame intent, and upon the ſame reaſon, and further he ſaid that although the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. contains in its purview the ſame diſabilities; Yet this Fine is plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and therefore the pleading of the ſame ſhall not be directed nor waged by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which doth not alter the pleading of a Fine which was before, nor the reaſon of it; for it is not properly a Statute, nor do Fines receive any ſtrength or virtue by it, but is but a conſtruction of the ſaid former Statute. And he put the Caſe betwixt <hi>Hide</hi> and <hi>Umpton;</hi> where <hi>Umpton</hi> mean betwixt the Statutes of 32 and 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Declared his Will of all his Lands, which deviſe if it be good for two parts of the Land deviſed it was doubted, or that the deviſe ſhould be void for the whole; afterwards came the Stat. of 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and cleared the doubt, for to that intent it was made; and in the ſaid Statute there is a Proviſo, that the ſaid Statute ſhall not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the Will or the Deviſe of <hi>Tho. Umpton,</hi> or ſhall be prejudicial or hurtful to any perſon or perſons for any Lands <hi>&amp;c.</hi> contained or ſpecified in the ſaid Will or Deviſe, but that the ſaid Will and Deviſe ſhall ſtand, remain and be in the ſame caſe, in force and effect in the Law, as the ſame was before the making of this Act. Now, notwithſtanding that Proviſo, the Will of <hi>Umpton</hi> was holden good but for two parts, for ſo the Statute of 34. <hi>H.</hi> 8. conſtrued the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. So in our Caſe, the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Fines conſtrues the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. to extend to Fines levyed by Tenant in tail, therefore the eſtate tail ſhall be adjudged in Law to be bound by the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and not by 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which is rather a Iudgment upon the ſaid Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. than any new Statute. <hi>Windham</hi> to the ſame intent, and he relyed upon the reaſon aforeſaid. And further ſaid, if one will plead a Leaſe made by Tenant in tail upon the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. he need not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the full age of the Leſſor, and yet that quality of full age is within the purview of the ſaid Statute. Firſt all Leaſes to be made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by any perſon being of full age, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo is the common uſe of pleadings. And of the ſame opinion was the Lord <hi>Anderſon</hi> for the ſaid Exception, for the reaſons, and upon the difference aforeſaid. Another Exception was taken to the Bar, becauſe it is not alledged, that the ſaid Fine was engroſſed in the ſame Term in which it was levyed. And as to that, it was holden by <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that in pleading of a Fine it needs not to ſhew any engroſſing of it; and ſo are many Preſidents, <hi>vide Plowd. Com. Smith</hi> and <hi>Stapletons</hi> Caſe, 15 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 428. Where a Fine was plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Quaedam finalis concordia facta fuit in Octav. Sancti Hillarii</hi> 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp; poſtea a die Paſch. in quindecem dies</hi> 36 <hi>H</hi> 8. <hi>conceſſa &amp; recordata, &amp;c. Super quem finem pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clam. ſecundum formam Statuti factae fuer. viz. prima proclam.</hi> 7. <hi>Maii. Term. Paſch.</hi> 36 <hi>H.</hi> 8. without any mention of the engroſſing of it: And ſee the Caſe betwixt <hi>Stowel</hi> and the Lord <hi>Zouch,</hi> where the Fine is pleaded as it is pleaded in the Caſe at Bar, <hi>quiquidem finis in forma praedict. levatus</hi> (and that fine was levyed <hi>Paſch.</hi> 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8.) <hi>ingroſſatus fuit, &amp; poſtea in Curia praedict. ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum formam Stattui, &amp;c. lectus, &amp; proclamatus fuit, viz. prim. proclam. Term. Paſch.</hi> 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And ſo upon the matter it is ſufficient to ſhew, that the Fine was engroſſed the ſame term in which it was levyed, for the Fine is pleaded to be levyed <hi>Term. Paſch. qui quidem Finis ingroſſatus fuit, &amp; poſtea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clam. viz. prim. proclam. Termino Paſch.</hi> which was the ſame Term it was
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:53034:45"/>
levyed: And ſo, admit, that in pleading it ought to be ſhewed that the Fine was ingroſſed in the ſame Term in which it was levyed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now it appears here to us by neceſſary conſequence, that the Fine was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed accordingly. And alſo the Ingroſſment is pleaded as the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute is penned, for the words of the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. are, after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing of every Fine, the ſame Fine to be openly read and proclaimed in the ſame Court, the ſame Term, and ſo the words of our plea here purſue the words of the Statute; for the ſaid Statute doth not require by expreſs words, that the Fine be engroſſed the ſame Term, but the ſame is to be conceived by matter of conſtruction and implication, and according to ſuch manner of ſpeech this plea is pleaded. And of the ſame opinion was <hi>Windham,</hi> and upon the ſame reaſon <hi>Anderſon</hi> conceived, that the Tenant in pleading of the Fine ought to ſhew in expreſs words, that the Fine was engroſſed the ſame Term in which it was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed; for whoſoever in pleading a plea will take the benefit of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ought preciſely to follow the Statute in all points; and it is clear, that if the Fine be not engroſſed, according to the Statute, that then it is not any bar by the Statute, and therefore it ought to be expreſly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged according to the Statute, and not by implication only.</p>
               <p>Another Exception was taken to the Bar (as was remembred by <hi>Windham) i. pro ut per finem hic in Curia de recordo remanen-plenius apparet;</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaying, <hi>&amp; per proclamation. inde, &amp;c.</hi> But that Exception was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed by <hi>Periam</hi> and <hi>Windham,</hi> for the Fine had been good and well pleaded, without any ſuch concluſion, <hi>pro ut, &amp;c.</hi> And alſo the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are endorſed upon the Fine, and then they appear upon the Fine, according to the words of the ſaid concluſion. And ſo by <hi>Windham</hi> are many Preſidents, and ſo in the ſaid Caſe between <hi>Stowel</hi> and the Lord <hi>Zouch</hi> cited before, <hi>pro ut per finem illum hic de record. remanen. plane liquet.</hi> And See 1 <hi>Eliz. Plowden</hi> 224. between <hi>Willion</hi> and <hi>Barkly,</hi> a Fine plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any <hi>pro ut, &amp;c. Anderſon</hi> took an Exception to the Bar at the beginning of it, <hi>i. Quod medietas</hi> 60 <hi>Meſſuagiorum, &amp;c. parcel. medietatis</hi> 70 <hi>Meſſuag. praedict.</hi> that that is no good pleading; for one moyety can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be parcel of another moyety, for every moyety is entire.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rhodes</hi> took Exception to the Replication, becauſe the Demandant in avoidance of the Fine, that at the time of the Fine levyed <hi>Bamfield</hi> was ſeiſed, <hi>&amp; ſemper poſtea, &amp; hucuſque, &amp;c.</hi> of the moyety in Demeſn, and doth not traverſe the ſeiſin of the Conuſor at the time of the Fine le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed, for here two contrary pleas ſtand before us in equity of truth; <hi>aeque vera, aeque falſa, aeque dubia,</hi> and a traverſe would have made an end of all, and reduced the matter to certainty: And by <hi>Periam,</hi> the Bar is not anſwered, for every Bar ought to be traverſed, confeſſed, or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, See 6 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5, and 6. where it is ſaid by <hi>Huſſey</hi> and <hi>Fairfax,</hi> where matter in fact is alledged by way of Bar it ought to be traverſed, if it be not for the miſcheif of tryal, as in caſe of Baſterdy, where a thing is alledged to be done beyond the ſea; or to leave the matter in Law to the Court, without putting the ſame to the Iudgment of the Lay-people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See alſo 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. Where it is holden, that a thing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial alledged in the Bar ought to be directly traverſed, or confeſſed, or avoided in fact or in Law, or conclude the other party by matter of eſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel: And that two affirmatives cannot make a good iſſue; But the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alledged in the Replication <hi>ſcil.</hi> that <hi>Bamfield</hi> was ſeiſed at the time of the Fine levyed ſhall be holden for void, and the matter alledged in the Bar, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that the Counſor was ſeiſed, as not anſwered; for it ſhall be taken true, until it ſhall be avoided and deſtroyed by matter in Law, traverſe, <hi>&amp;c. Vide Librum.</hi> So he in default of traverſe, the Bar is not anſwered but argumentative, <hi>ſcil. Bamfield</hi> was ſeiſed, <hi>ergo,</hi> the Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor was not ſeiſed: And it is a common learning that in every Repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation there ought to be certainty as to that: See the Caſe betwixt <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſton</hi> and <hi>Steward</hi> 2 <hi>Ma.</hi> 103. that a Bar ought not to be anſwered by argument:
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:53034:46"/>
And as to the certainty which is requiſite in a Replication. See the Caſe betwixt <hi>Wimbiſh</hi> and <hi>Talboies, Plow. Com.</hi> 4 <hi>E.</hi> 6. 42. where the Plaintiff ſhewed in his Replication his title as Heir, but becauſe he did not ſhew, how heir, for want of ſuch certainty in the Replicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Plaintiff could never have Iudgment, although the Iuſtices for the matter in Law then in queſtion were clearly reſolved for the Plaintiff; and here in this Replication the incertainty is ſuch, that the Court doth not know to which to give credit, to the Plaintiff, or to the Def. and the bare matter of the Replication is not ſufficient; For in avoidance of a Fine, to ſay, that a ſtranger to the Fine, at the time of the Fine levyed, was ſeiſed, was never received, but that, <hi>partes Finis ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil habuerunt,</hi> that was the ordinary plea. <hi>Windham</hi> to the ſame intent; that which the Demandant hath alledged in avoydance of the Fine, is but matter of Argument and implication. And we ought in this Caſe firſt to be inſured of the matter of fact; <hi>ſcil.</hi> Whether <hi>Zouch</hi> or <hi>Bamfield</hi> were ſeiſed, and the Court doth not know to which to give credit, 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 49. in Debt by an Executor, the Defendant pleaded, that the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor made the Plaintiff and one <hi>A.</hi> his Executor, wich <hi>A.</hi> is living, and the Plaintiff pleaded, that the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> died within ſuch a Ward before the Writ brought, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and adjudged no plea, without traverſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, he was dead, for here are 2 affirmatives, whereon a good iſſue cannot riſe, which ſee 32 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 23. The Def. in a Replevin avows for a Rent ſervice, the Plaint. pleads, out of his Fee, the Avowant ſaith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Fee, he ought to traverſe, without that it is out of his Fee, and for default of the traverſe the pleading of both parties; as to the ſeveral allegations of the ſeiſin in <hi>Bamfield</hi> and <hi>Zouch</hi> may be true, for they both might be Ioynt-tenants of the ſaid moyety at the time of the Fine le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed, in which caſe, as to the moyety of the moyety it is good enough. And yet when in pleading it is alledged, that <hi>A.</hi> was ſeiſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If the other party plead, that <hi>A.</hi> had nothing but joyntly with <hi>B.</hi> he ought to take a Traverſe, without that, that <hi>A.</hi> was ſole ſeiſed, and yet ſole ſeiſin is not expreſly alledged; but when the other party pleads, that <hi>A.</hi> was ſeiſed, it ought to be intended a ſole ſeiſin. Which See 1 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 9. 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 31. And it was never a plea admittable againſt a Fine, to ſay, that the Conuſor had nothing at the time of the Fine levyed, which ſee 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 14. and alſo 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 13. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 27. In Treſpaſs the Defendant pleaded the Fine of the Anceſtor of the Plaintiff, who ſaid, at the time of the Fine levyed he himſelf was ſeiſed, without that that <hi>partes ad finem aliquid habuerunt,</hi> which ſee 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 14. and a Fine ought to be avoided by not ſeiſin of the parties to the Fine, and not by the ſeiſin of a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Fine; and there is not any Book in the Law that alloweth ſuch an averment of ſeiſin in a ſtranger to the Fine, without anſwering to the ſeiſin of the parties to the Fine, but 13 <hi>H.</hi> 8. In Aſſiſe, the Tenant pleaded a Fine upon Render of the Anceſtor of the Plaintiff, to which the Plaintiff ſaid, that before the Fine, at the time of the Fine, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards continually, he himſelf was ſeiſed, and the ſame was held no plea againſt ſuch a Fine upon a Render, notwithſtanding the privity of blood; contrary, againſt a Fine, which proves a gift precedent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon</hi> to the ſame intent. The Replication for want of Traverſe is incurable, for we as Iudges do not know what to do, becauſe that the truth of the matter in fact doth not appear unto us, and ſo neither the matter in Law; for every plea ought to be traverſed, or confeſſed, and avoided, otherwiſe nothing appears to us, and we cannot know whether the Conuſor or <hi>Bamfield</hi> were ſeiſed at the time of the Fine le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyed, for otherwiſe the matter in Law cannot riſe; and yet I well know, that although a traverſe may be ſpared in reſpect of a matter in Law which ſhould be choaked and put out of the Book by the traverſe, or for the miſchief of the tryal as aforeſaid, where a thing is alledged to be done beyond ſea. 19 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 6. In debt the Defendant pleaded, that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff was born at <hi>Denmark,</hi> under the obedience of the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:53034:46"/>
the Plaintiff by Replication ſaid, that he himſelf was born at <hi>D.</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in the County of <hi>York,</hi> there he ſhall not take a traverſe without that, that he was born at <hi>Denmark,</hi> for there ſuch tryal connot be, but in ſuch caſe the Defendant by way of Rejoynder ſhall ſay, that the Plaint. was born at <hi>Denmark,</hi> without that that he was born at <hi>D.</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>York:</hi> And it is true, a ſuppoſal of a Writ or Count may be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an Affirmative; but a matter alledged by expreſs words cannot.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rhodes,</hi> admitting now that the Bar be naught, and the Replication faulty, as it is, then I conceive, that if the point of the Action be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the Bar, the Court ſhall give Iudgment upon the Bar, and ſhall not meddle with the Replication; but if it be not confeſſed by the Bar, that then there ſhall be a Repleader. And I do conceive, that a Repleader may be awarded upon a Demurrer in Law: which ſee <hi>Plowd.</hi> 1 <hi>Ma.</hi> in the Caſe betwixt <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſton</hi> 138. In Treſpaſs the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff doth ſuppoſe the Treſpaſs in two places, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in <hi>Bermeſtreet</hi> and in <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark</hi> in the County of <hi>Surrey;</hi> as to the Treſpaſs in <hi>Southwark</hi> the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant doth juſtifie by ſpecial matter of a Leaſe, without anſwering any thing to the Treſpaſs in <hi>Bermeſtreet.</hi> The Plaintiff doth reply, and makes his title by a Leaſe more ancient than the Leaſe to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; upon which the Defendant doth demurr in Law. Now the defect in the Bar appearing, the Court awarded a Repleader. And 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 35. in a Replevin the Defendant avowed for damage feſant. The Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff made title by Common. The Defendant pleaded a Releaſe of the Common by deed, which was not a perfect deed, upon which the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff did demurr in Law: And the Replication, in which the imperfect Releaſe was, was holden naught, but becauſe there was a defect in the Bar to the Avowry by the title of Common, the Court awarded, that the parties ſhould replead, not in reſpect of the vitious plea upon which it was demurred, but in reſpect of the defect in Bar: And ſo in this Caſe <hi>Periam</hi> ſaid, that nothing ſhould be awarded in this Caſe but where an Iſſue is joyned, for an Iſſue is always joyned upon a point certain. But upon a demurrer all the parts of the pleading, the Count, the Bar, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are referred to the Court, as well for the form as for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The Book which hath been vouched to the contrary out of 9 <hi>H.</hi> 6. I have procured ſearch to be made for the Roll, but it cannot be found, and it is inconvenient, that after a demurrer a Repleader ſhould be granted, for then Cauſes ſhould never have an end: And as to the Caſe betwixt <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſton,</hi> the Repleader there was permitted by the aſſent of the parties, rather then awarded by the Rule of the Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Windham</hi> to the ſame intent, that no Repleader ſhall be in this Caſe, and he ſaid, that in the time of the Lord <hi>Dyer</hi> the opinion of the Court was ſo: And as this caſe is, the plea a Bar being good, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer being upon the Replication, no Repleader ſhould be, for a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleader ſhall never be granted, where the plea upon a Demurrer is not good; but if the Bar be not good, and the Defendant doth demurr up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Replication, there a Repleader may be. And as to <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſtons</hi> Caſe he conceived, that the parties did plead <hi>de novo,</hi> but not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plead, for if it had been a Repleader, then the parties ſhould begin to plead where the firſt defect was, as if the defect be in the Bar, there the Repleader ſhall begin, but the Declaration ſhall ſtand: But in the ſaid Caſe of <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſton,</hi> the Plaintiff pleaded all <hi>de novo,</hi> as a new Count, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet the firſt defect was in the Bar, and therefore he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that there it was not a Repleader, but that the parties by aſſent did plead <hi>de novo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon</hi> was of opinion, that as this Caſe is, no Repleader ſhall be, and yet he held the Repleader might be upon a Demurrer as well as upon an Iſſue joyned; For a Demurrer joyned is an Iſſue to be tryed by the Iudges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſuch was the opinion of <hi>Manwood</hi> chief Baron. And the Iudgment in the Caſe betwixt <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſton</hi> is not that the parties
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:53034:47"/>
ſhall plead <hi>de novo,</hi> but that they ſhall replead. See there <hi>folio</hi> 138. <hi>a.</hi> and in that Caſe there might well be a Repleader, for there the truth of the matter in fact is confeſſed in the pleading, but in the Caſe at Bar it is otherwiſe, for the pleading is ſo obſcure, that we do not know the truth of the matter, and the right of the matter doth not appear unto us.</p>
               <p>And by <hi>Periam,</hi> as to that which hath been ſaid, that upon the demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer upon the Replication, the ſeiſin of <hi>Bamfield</hi> at the time of the Fine is confeſſed. Sir, its not ſo, for no more ſhall be holden confeſſed by a demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but that which is duly and ſufficiently pleaded, and becauſe the ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin of <hi>Bamfield</hi> is not ſufficiently pleaded, therefore not confeſſed; and for proof of that learning, ſee the Caſe betwixt <hi>Wimbiſh</hi> and <hi>Talboies;</hi> and the Caſe betwixt <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Graunge:</hi> 1 <hi>Mar. Plowd.</hi> 171. and ſee the Caſe betwixt <hi>Partridge</hi> and <hi>Croker;</hi> and ſo was opinion of the Lord <hi>Anderſon,</hi> who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyed much upon the Caſe, where it is ſaid, that in pleading a plea, all matters in fact well and materially alledged by a general Demurrer are confeſſed to be true.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Rhodes.</hi> Now we are to ſee, if by the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Replication may be ſalved, and I conceive, that this Statute doth extend to all imperfections which happen by the Act; Miſpriſion, or negligence of the Clarks or Counſel; for the Clyent propounds his Cauſe to the Clark and his Counſel to manage in the courſe of his ſuit, and if the Clark or Counſel err therein, or in that which to them belongeth, the Cſyent as to that ſhall be releived by the Statute; but if there be any defect in the matter, ſo as the matter will not ſerve, it is otherwiſe. As 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. In the Roll of a plea there were divers ſpaces (for the year and day) void and blank, in another Term, the Iudges could not amend them, but now by the ſaid Statute they may. So co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour in Aſſiſe wanting is helped by this Statute, ſo the uſual averment, <hi>&amp; hoc paratus eſt verificare, &amp;c.</hi> left out, the Court hath power to amend it, and ſo by him the Court by this Statute hath power to amend that defect in Treſpaſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Antea 43, 44.</note>
                  <hi>Periam</hi> to the contrary. And that this default of Traverſe is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable by the ſaid Statute, for it is enacted by the ſaid Statute, that upon a Demurrer the Iudges ſhall give Iudgment as the right of the cauſe and matter in Law ſhall require; but in our caſe, as the pleading now is, no right of the cauſe or matter in Law appeareth according to which we can judge, for we upon this pleading cannot tell whether the Conuſor or <hi>Bamfield</hi> was ſeiſed at the time of the Fine levyed, for upon the Demurrer upon the Replication the ſeiſin of <hi>Bamfield</hi> is not confeſſed, becauſe it is not well alledged: And if it had been well alledged, yet it had not been confeſſed, becauſe that the Tenant who demurrs upon the Replication, hath in his Bar expreſly alledged, that the Conuſor was ſeiſed: An Original Writ of Debt againſt one as Executor in the <hi>debet</hi> and <hi>detinet</hi> could not be amended by 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. but now by the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it may. See 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 21, 22. So <hi>nominare</hi> for <hi>praeſentare</hi> in a <hi>Quare Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit</hi> ſhall be now amended by this Statute; And in a Writ of <hi>Formedon, diſcendere</hi> for <hi>remanere</hi> ſhall be amended by the ſaid Statute of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>vide.</hi> 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1, 2 3. In Aſſiſe, upon whom the Plaintiff, where it ſhould be upon whom the Defendant entred; And if the Averment uſual as above was miſs-ſet down, it was amendable, but if it were utterly left out, not, but now in both Caſes it is amendable, ſo, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendit vim &amp; injuriam quando, &amp;c.</hi> if it be left out, it is amendable, for all theſe matters lye in the Conuſance of the Clark, but in our Caſe, the right of the cauſe and matter doth not appear unto us, for if <hi>Bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> was ſeiſed at the time of the Fine levyed, then as the Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant and his Counſel pretend, the Law is with the Demandant, and if the Conuſor and not the Demandant, then the Law is with the Tenant, as his Counſel hath argued, ſo as the right of the cauſe conſiſts and depends upon the truth of the ſeiſin, which matter doth not appear unto us: And if we enter in courſe of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:53034:47"/>
we do not know if the Demandant would have traverſed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that that the Conuſor was ſeiſed, which ſhall not be a good Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, or <hi>abſque hoc, quod partes ad finem aliquid habuerunt, &amp;c.</hi> which although it be a good Traverſe in Law, yet we do not know if the truth of the cauſe will ſerve to maintain ſuch matter, and becauſe without altering matter we cannot amend the Plea. <hi>Windham</hi> to the ſame purpoſe; For by the Statute of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> we ought to judge in this caſe, as the right of the cauſe and matter in Law ſhall appear; but in this caſe neither the right of the cauſe nor the matter in Law appeareth unto us, according to which we can judge, for we know not to which of the parties to give credit, touching the ſeiſin of the Conuſor, or <hi>Bamfeild</hi> at the time of the Fine levyed, for as to our judicial knowledge, both Pleas are to us equally dubious; And he agreed the Caſes put before touching amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of matters upon default of the Clark, <hi>ſcil. de hoc ponit ſe ſuper patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> left out, ſo colour in Aſſize, and Treſpaſs wanting, ſo, <hi>&amp; hoc paratus eſt verificare,</hi> all which matters are amendable by the Statute of 27. <hi>Eliz.</hi> But he ſaid, that if in Treſpaſs the Defendant doth juſtify by a Leaſe for years, without ſhewing the place where the Leaſe is made, it is not amendable, for it is matter which lyeth in the notice of the party only, and not in our judicial knowledge: And as to the Caſe of 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. of the places left, he conceived it is not amendable in another Term by this Statute, for that is material, and the filling of thoſe ſpaces the parties themſelves ſhall ſupply and not the Court, for the Court ſhall never amend, where their amendment makes alteration of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the pleading, or of the Verdict, as 20 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 15. In Treſpaſs, the Plaintiff declared of a <hi>continuando uſque diem impetrationis brevis, viz.</hi> 18. <hi>die Martii,</hi> where the Teſte of the Writ was, 2 <hi>die Januarij,</hi> the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant pleaded to Iſſue, which was found for the Plaintiff, and that Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſion of the Teſte or date of the Writ could not be amended. And no amendment upon this Stat. of 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> two things are to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Firſt, that the Iudges, in ſuch amendment, medle not with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor alter the ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that they do not amend but according to their judicial knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon,</hi> to the ſame intent, for as it hath been ſaid before, the truth of the Caſe doth not appear unto us according to which we can judge, and I conceive that upon any amendment upon this Statute, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take out one Roll and put in another, and as our caſe is we cannot amend this defect without taking out the whole Roll, and therefore in the Caſe of <hi>Leonard,</hi> which was late <hi>Cuſtos brevium</hi> here, where in a Replevin he avowed for a Rent-ſervice, and upon eſpecial Verdict the Caſe was, that Sir <hi>Henry Iſley</hi> held of the ſaid <hi>Leonard</hi> by Fealty, and the Rent mentioned in the Avowry, and was attainted of high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the King ſeiſed and granted the Land to the Plaintiff, upon whom <hi>Leonard</hi> avowed for the Rent-ſervice, and I and my companions were agreed, that the rent, notwithſtanding the ſeiſure and grant of the King remained diſtrainable of common right, but <hi>Leonard</hi> could not have return of the Cattel, becauſe he had avowed for a Rent-ſervice, &amp; now it appeareth to us upon the Verdict, that he had right to ſo much rent, but not to ſuch a Rent, but a Rent-ſeck diſtrainable of common right, ſo a Rent in another degree; and we alſo agreed, that the Avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry was not amendable, for then upon ſuch amendment, we ought to take out a whole Roll, which was not intended by this Statute: And he conceived alſo, that in debt againſt Executors in the <hi>Debet &amp; detinet,</hi> ſuch a Writ ſhall not be amended by this Statute, and he conceived, that his exception to the Bar, <hi>quod ad medietatem,</hi> 60. <hi>Meſſuag. &amp;c. parcel. medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etatis, &amp;c.</hi> is relieved by this Statute, for the meaning appeareth: And alſo the exception, that it is not expreſly ſhewed that the Fine was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed in the ſame Term in which it was levied.

In Treſpaſs for taking of his Cattel, the Defendant as to parcel pleaded not guilty, and as to the remnant pleaded another Plea, upon which the parties did demur, and there they proceeded to trial before the matter in Law determined, and found for the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, and he had Iudgment thereupon for the damages, but the coſts were ſuſpended until, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Defendant brought his Writ of Error. 48 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 15. In an Action of Waſt, as to parcel the Defendant pleads, no Waſt, and as to the reſt pleaded matter in Law, upon which there was a demurer joyned; It was holden, that the Iſſue ſhould not be tried until the matter in Law be determined: But it was ſaid by <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorpe</hi> in Treſpaſs, if the Defendant to parcel plead the Enqueſt, and to other parcel matter in Law, in ſuch caſe he ſhould proceed to trial preſently, and damages ſhould be taxed of the whole, as well of that upon which there was a demurrer in Law, as of that of which the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue was joyned, <hi>ad quod non fuit reſponſum.</hi> See alſo 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 228. In Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, the Defendant pleaded to Iſſue for part, and for the reſidue did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur in Law, Proceſs for the trial iſſued before the matter in Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; And <hi>Periam</hi> conceived that the Court might proceed in ſuch Caſe, the one way or the other: As to the matter in Law, whether the iſſue in tail upon this Fine ſhould have the Averment, he conceived, that he ſhould not have the ſaid Averment, for that it ſhould be very peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to the Inheritances of the ſubjects. And he argued much upon the dignity of Fines out of <hi>Bracton</hi> and <hi>Glanvil,</hi> whom he called <hi>Actores, non Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thores Legis;</hi> &amp; that Fines at the common Law were of great authority until the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. And afterwards by the Statute of 34 <hi>E.</hi> 3. of non-claim, from whence they became to be of ſo little value in Law, that they were accounted no other than Feoffments upon Record, ſo as thereby no aſſurance was of Inheritances but a general incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty until the Statute of 4. <hi>H.</hi> 7. by which Statute they were reſtored to their ancient power and virtue: After which Statute many ſhifts were deviſed, to creep out of it: So as the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was made to take away all queſtions and ambiguities which were conceived upon the ſaid Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. And therefore we who are Iudges ought to frame our Iudgments for the maintaining of the authority of Fines, for ſo the poſſeſſions and inheritances of the Subjects ſhall be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; And that is the reaſon, that if a ſtranger levy a Fine of my Land in my name, that I have not any remedy but a Writ of Deceit againſt him who levyes the Fine, ſo if a Feme-covert levyeth a Fine of her Land as a Feme-ſole, the ſame ſhall bind her after the coverture, if the Husband do not enter upon the Conuſee during the coverture and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the poſſeſſion gained by the Fine: And 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and our Books are very plentiful to this purpoſe that the Law doth <hi>aerge</hi> admit of ſuch allegations againſt ſuch Fines: A Fine was pleaded in Bar of Land in <hi>A. B.</hi> and <hi>C.</hi> he againſt whom it was pleaded was not received to aver a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſuppoſal of the Fine, that there was no ſuch Town or Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let as <hi>A.</hi> 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 5. A woman Tenant in tail, had Iſſue a Daughter, who was inheritable to the tail, the Daughter took a Husband, &amp; they both living the Mother, and during her ſeiſin, levied a Fine of the Land en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed to a ſtranger, <hi>ſur conuſans de droit, come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> who rendred the Land to the Husband and Wife in ſpecil tail, the Husband died having Iſſue, the Wife took another Husband, had Iſſue, and died, the Husband to entitie himſelf to the Land as Tenant by the curteſy, would in pleading have averred the ſeiſin of the Mother at the time of the Fine levyed, and he could not, and yet he was a ſtranger to the Fine, but he was privy to the eſtate, and his claim was by her who levyed the Fine, 6 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 46. <hi>Fitz.

Where it is ſaid by <hi>Stone,</hi> that ſince the gift is proved by as high a Record, a man ſhall not aver againſt ſuch matter in avoidance of the ſaid Fine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet the party againſt whom it was was a ſtranger to the Fine: And ſee 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 7. The Lord ſhall not be received againſt a Fine levied by his Tenant to aver the dying ſeiſed of his Tenant in his Homage. And as to the Iſſue in tail, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the Averment doth not lie for him, for the Iſſue in tail is as much privy, as the Heir of a Tenant in Fee-ſimple. And ſee 33 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>ſcil. Eſtoppel</hi> 280. In a <hi>Formedon,</hi> the Tenant voucheth, the Demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Counter-pleaded, that the Vouchee nor any of his Anceſtors had any thing in the Land in demand after the ſeiſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which the Tenant ſaid, that to that the Demandant ſhould not be received, for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Demandant after the gift levied a Fine to the Anceſtor of the Vouchee of the ſaid Land in demand, <hi>ſur conuſans de droit come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> and the ſame was holden a good bar to the Counter-plea.</p>
               <p>And it was ſaid by the Iuſtices, That although the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. of <hi>Donis conditionalibus,</hi> doth not avoid the Fine as to the fore-cloſing of the Iſſue in tail of his <hi>Formedon,</hi> yet it remaineth in force as to the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>training of the heir in tail to aver a thing againſt the Fine as well as againſt the heir in Fee-ſimple; and in all Caſes, where he againſt whom a Fine is pleaded claims by him who levieth the Fine, he ſhall not have the ſame Averment, but where he claims by a ſtranger to the Fine, there he ſhall have it well enough; ſee 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 18. If my Father Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail, or in Fee, grant the Land by Fine, and afterwards I make Title to the ſame Land by the ſame Anceſtor, and the Fine is pleaded againſt me, I ſhall not be received to ſay that thoſe who were parties to the Fine had not any thing at the time of the Fine levied, but ſuch a one an eſtranger whoſe eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but it is a good Plea for me to ſay, that after the Fine ſuch a one was ſeiſed in Fee, and did enfeoff me, <hi>vid.</hi> 22 <hi>E</hi> 3. 17. before 33 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Eſtoppel</hi> 280. And <hi>Dyer</hi> 16 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 334. The Father is Tenant for life, the Remainder in Fee to his Son and Heir, levieth a Fine to a ſtranger, <hi>ſur conuſans de droit come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> with warranty, and takes back an eſtate by the ſame Fine, in that caſe it was holden that the heir ſhould not be received to aver continuance of the poſſeſſion and ſeiſin, either <hi>ante finem, tempore finis,</hi> or <hi>poſt finem,</hi> in the Tenant for life, for it is a Feoffment upon Record, and makes a diſcontinuance of the Remainder and Reverſion. The only Book in our Law to maintain the Averment is 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 15. by <hi>Brian,</hi> who although he was a reverend Iudge in his time, yet he erred in this, that if Tenant in tail be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiſed, and levieth a Fine unto a ſtranger, <hi>ſur conuſans de droit, come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> that the Iſſue in tail may well ſay, that <hi>partes ad finem nihil habuerunt,</hi> but <hi>Coke</hi> and <hi>Lit.</hi> were clear of a contrary opinion and ſee in the ſame year, <hi>fol.</hi> 12 by <hi>Fairfax</hi> and <hi>Littleton,</hi> that if Tenant in tail, where the Remainder is over to a ſtranger, levieth a Fine <hi>ſur conuſans dodroit, come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> he in the Remainder may aver continuance of ſeiſin againſt that Fine, for he is not party, nor heir to the party, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Stat. of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. goes ſtrongly, to extort ſuch Averment out of the mouth of the Iſſue in tail, for the words concerning the ſame point are, ſaving to every perſon or perſons, not party, nor privy to the ſaid Fine, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to avoid the ſaid Fine, by that, that thoſe which were parties to the ſaid Fine nor any of them had ought in the Land at the time of the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:53034:49"/>
ſaid Fine levied: And it is clear, that the Iſſue in tail is privy to his Anceſtor whoſe heir to the tail he is, which ſee agreed, 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. 7. And he vouched the Caſe of one <hi>Stamford</hi> late adjudged, Land was given to the eldeſt Son in tail, the Remainder to the Father in tail, the eldeſt Son levied a Fine, <hi>ſur conuſans de droit come ceo, &amp;c.</hi> and died without Iſſue in the life of his Father, and afterwards the Father died; the ſecond Son ſhall inherit; but if the eldeſt Son had ſurvived the Father, and afterwards died without Iſſue, the ſecond Son ſhould have been barred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Periam</hi> to the ſame intent: It ſhould be very dangerous to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritances of the Subjects to admit of ſuch Averments, and by ſuch means Fines which ſhould be of great force and effect ſhould be much weakned, and he put many Caſes to the ſame purpoſe as were put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Rhodes</hi> Iuſtice, and he ſhewed how that Fines, and the power of them were much weakned by the Statute of non-claim, whereof fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed (as the preface of the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. obſerveth) the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal trouble of the Kings Subjects, and therefore by the ſaid Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. Fines, for the good and ſafety of the Subjects were reſtored to their former Grandure and authority, which ſhould be conſtrued by us who are Iudges, ſtrongly and liberally for the quiet and eſtabliſhment of preſent poſſeſſions, and for the barring and extinguiſhing of former rights, and ſo did the Iudges our Predeceſſors; which ſee in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid Caſe between <hi>Stowel</hi> and the Lord <hi>Zouch:</hi> So ſee ſuch liberal conſtruction, 19 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 351. Where if Land be given to Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife in ſpecial tail, and the Husband alone levieth a Fine and dieth having Iſſue, the Iſſue is barred: And it hath lately been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the advice of all the Iudges of <hi>England,</hi> upon the Statute of 1 <hi>Ma. viz.</hi> All Fines levied, whereupon Proclamations ſhall not be day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made by reaſon of Adjournment of any Term, ſhall be of as good force and ſtrength to all intents and purpoſes, as if ſuch Term had been holden and kept from the beginning to the end thereof, and not adjourned, and the Proclamations ſhall be made in the following Term, which reaſon in conſtruction of the ſaid Statute, the Iudges in the caſe of the <hi>Cooks</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> 20. <hi>Eliz.</hi> have obſerved, which ſee <hi>Plowden</hi> 538. For although Succeſſors are not mentioned in the ſaid Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. but only Heirs, yet the Iudges did conſtrue the ſaid Statute to extend to them that they ſhould be bounden as well as the Heirs; for it is in the like miſchief, and the ſaid Statute was made for the publick good, and for the repoſe of the Inheritances of the Subjects of this Realm, and therefore the ſame ought to be largely extended in the meaning and ſenſe of it, and for the benefit of the Poſſeſſors of the Lands, and to the deſtroying of former rights which were not claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It hath been ſaid, that this Fine is but a Fine by concluſion, and not in verity; and therefore not within the Statute. But without queſtion, Fines by concluſion are within the Statute. And that is clear by the Saving, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to all perſons other than parties to the ſaid Fines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Periam</hi> was againſt the opinion in <hi>Stowells</hi> Caſe by <hi>Sanders</hi> 356. A Diſſeiſor maks a Feoffment in fee upon condition, the Feoffee levies a Fine with Proclamation, five years paſs, the condition is broken, the Diſſeiſſor re-entreth, and <hi>Periam</hi> conceived that in ſuch Caſe the Diſſeiſſee is bounden, for by the Fine, and five years non-claim, the right of every ſtranger is barred, and when the Diſſeiſſor entreth for the condition broken, the Fine is not annoyed, but rather confirmed, and former rights ſhall not be revived. <hi>Windham</hi> to the ſame intent, and vouched the Books before remembred, and that the meaning of the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. made upon the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. was to bind the Iſſue in tail as ſtrongly as the heir of Tenant in Fee-ſimple was bound at the common Law, and that Fines by concluſion are as fully within the purview of that Statute as Fines in verity, for Fines by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion are Aſſurances; And as to the objection againſt our Fine, that it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:53034:49"/>
is not <hi>rite levatus</hi> becauſe that <hi>partes ad finem nihil habuerunt, &amp;c.</hi> the ſame is no reaſon, wherefore this Fine ſhould not be <hi>rite levatus,</hi> for theſe words <hi>rite levatus,</hi> to the external form of a Fine are to be taken as to a Fine levied, <hi>coram Edmundo Anderſon &amp; ſocijs ſuis,</hi> where all the Iuſtices ought to be named, and ſo it ſeemed alſo to <hi>Periam</hi> and <hi>Anderſon.</hi> Our caſe had little reſemblance to the Caſe where Tenant in tail maks a Leaſe according to the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. if he be not ſeiſed at the time of the demiſe, it is void; for the Stat. ſpeaks ſeiſed in tail: but ſo are not penned the Statutes of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. as 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. a Fine levied ſhall bind privies, &amp; ſtrangers, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;</hi> 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Fines levied of any Lands en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed to the Conuſor or any of his Anceſtors, and it is not a Fine in reſpect of the poſſeſſion which paſſeth by the Fine, but in reſpect of the Concord and Agreement,</p>
               <p>And Tenant in tail by theſe Statutes hath as great power to bind the right of the entail, although he cannot meddle with the poſſeſſion, as the Tenant in Fee-ſimple at the common Law.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anderſon</hi> to the ſame intent, All the matter reſts upon this point, if the Iſſue in tail be privy or not, for if he be privy, then clearly he is bounden. And as to that, the Iſſue in tail before the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath been always accounted privy. See 29 <hi>H</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 32. Tenant in tail of the gift of the King levieth a Fine, the ſame ſhall bind his Iſſue, for they are privy. And he argued much upon the Caſes cited by the other Iuſtices before, and eſpecially upon the ſaid Caſe of <hi>Stowel</hi> and the Lord <hi>Zouch;</hi> how that the Iſſue in tail is there holden privy; and that the Statute of Fines ought to be taken and conſtrued to enfore the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of Fines againſt former rights, and for the eſtabliſhment of the preſent poſſeſſions and eſtates. And by him divers rights and perſons are excepted by the ſaid Statute, but this right in groſs of poſſeſſion, nor the Iſſue in tail, whoſe Anceſtor being out of poſſeſſion levieth the Fine is not excepted, therefore both of them comprehended in the Statute. And in his argument he ſtood much upon it, how dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous a matter it ſhould be, to receive ſuch averments and allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which go meerly in avoidance of Fines, for ſo every Fine might fall in the mouth of the Lay-Gens, which would be very inconvenient.

And yet the Iury againſt the opinion of the Court upon that evidence found the Defendant guilty. And it was moved in arreſt of Iudgment, that the Evidence did not main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Information, nor prove the Iſſue, <hi>ex parte Querentis,</hi> and it was ſaid, there are three things within the Statute, <hi>i.</hi> three words, <hi>i.</hi> bargain, loan, and cheivizance, and theſe three are ſeveral things,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53034:55"/>
and therefore, if the Information be conceived upon loan, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former giveth in Evidence a corrupt bargain for cloth, as it is in this Caſe, the ſame doth not maintain the Information; So if the Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be granted upon uſurious contract by way of mortgage, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Evidence an uſurious loan, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> But if the Information had been conceived generally, upon an uſurious agreement, and giveth in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence a loan, the ſame is good enough, for every loan is an agreement.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Manwood,</hi> There cannot be any loan without bargain, nor any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing without bargain, for he contracts or bargains to do it, <hi>viz.</hi> to lend, or forbear: Bargain of forbearing is where the firſt day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not kept and the parties have agreed for a further day for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it appeareth in this Caſe, that it was a bargain to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear a ſum of mony which ſhould have been paid before; And the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation here is upon a bargain by way of loan, where was a bargain for forbearing. <hi>Fuller,</hi> this word (Bargain) in the Statute cannot be intended a bargain for wares or ſuch things, and ſo diſtinct from the other two things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If in Information upon loan, an uſurious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract had been given in Evidence, that would not maintain the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: And it was moved in this Caſe, if the time of the loan or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of the money ſhall be accounted according to eight &amp; twenty days to every month, or by the months in the Kalender, <hi>viz. January, February, &amp;c.</hi> And it ſeemed to ſome according to the days, as in caſe of the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of Recuſants; and others conceived contrary in both Caſes. And <hi>Fuller</hi> ſaid, That in the Caſe of policy of Aſſurance made to warrant a Ship, one was bound to warrant a Ship for twelve months; &amp; the truth was, ſhe did not periſh within the time of the twelve months, being accounted according to eight and twenty days, but being accounted by the Kalender, as <hi>January, Feb. &amp;c.</hi> it periſhed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and it was ſaid and holden, that he had not forfeited his Bond. <hi>Gent</hi> Baron. If I lend one a hundred pounds without any contract for Intereſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at the end of year he gives me twenty pounds for the loan thereof, the ſame is within the Statute, for my acceptance makes the offence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without any bargain or contract. And by <hi>Clarke</hi> Baron, the place where the Defendant accepted exceſſive Intereſt ought to be ſhewed in the Information, but not the place where the contract for the loan or forbearance was made, for the ſame is not needful. See the Caſe betwixt <hi>Stradling</hi> and <hi>Morgan, Plowd.</hi> 200. for the ſetting down of the place in the Declaration, where the Extortion was committed: The Information here is by way of corrupt bargain and loan. The Defendant took at <hi>Dertford</hi> ſuch a ſum, where the taking is layed, <hi>apud Dertford,</hi> but no place of the corrupt bargain or of the loan. And by <hi>Gent.</hi> If I lend to <hi>Beeſie</hi> for a year, and afterwards he takes further forbearance of another year beyond the rate, the ſame is within the Statute: but in all Caſes, the place where the corrupt bargain was made ought to be certainly alledged: <hi>Manwood</hi> Baron, the Information is not good for the incertainty of the place, where the corrupt bargain was made; and although there are many Preſidents on the Informes part, it is not to purpoſe, for they were admitted without exception, and then they paſſed <hi>ſub ſilentio,</hi> and ſo of no force. There are three things, or rather degrees of offences within the Statute. In uſury, within the Statute, there ought to be corrupt loan, cheiviſance, or ſhift, 1. corruption, 2. he ought to take more than eight pound for one hundred pounds, 3. it ought to be for lending or forbearing. There was a Caſe in this Court in the time of this Queen, that the Defendant had taken more than ten pounds in the hundred pounds, but in the Information no corruption in the bargain was alledged; and therefore Iudgment was given againſt the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: But in the Caſe at Bar corruption is ſet forth in <hi>facto,</hi> and therefore as to that the Information is good enough: As unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing &amp; giving of days of payment the ſame is alledged in the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:53034:55"/>
but not according to the Statute, for the Statute is in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive, but the Information is in the copulative; here in our Caſe the iſſue is Not guilty, under which general iſſue all the points of the Statute are included and ought to be tried; as unto the corruption the ſame is not ſufficiently laid, for no place is aſſigned where the corrupt bargain was made, <hi>ergo</hi> no <hi>viſne</hi> for it to be tried, <hi>ergo,</hi> no trial can be, <hi>ergo,</hi> no iſſue for it, <hi>ergo,</hi> this point of the Statute doth not come in iſſue, nor can it be tried upon the general iſſue, Not guilty. Alſo he held, that all the Offence ought to be within the year, for if one make a corrupt bargain for this year, and ten years after he takes exceſſive uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the ſame is not within the Statute to inform upon it. And in truth there is no ſuch offence without corrupt bargain, ſo as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the word (Lending) is a ſtrange word, but where the Statute is forbearing or giving day of payment, &amp; in the Information it is giving and forbearing in the copulative, that is good enough, for the one word enforceth the other, and is not double. Alſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation hath not ſhewed whoſe money it is, and therefore it is not good: And afterwards Iudgment was given againſt the Informer; and a Writ of Error thereupon brought in the Erchequer Chamber. And it was argued by <hi>Popham</hi> Attorney General, that Iudgment ought to have been given for the Queen and the Informer, for the ſhewing of the place where the corrupt bargain was made needs not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the Information, for the offence puniſhable by the Statute is the receipt of exceſſive uſury, and not the contract: And it was the Caſe of one <hi>Bird,</hi> 20 <hi>Eliz.</hi> where the Plaintiff ſhewed the place of the Receipt, and not of the contract, and yet had Iudgment for the Queen, without any exception to it before Iudgment, or Error after, for the contract is but inducement to the receipt, and it ſhall be tried where the taking was; therefore it is not neceſſary to ſhew the place of the bargain: And it was adjorned.</p>

And now the Commiſſion being returned, the parties appeared, and by their Council ſhewed, that ſome of their Lands returned in the Commiſſion are Copy-hold, and prayed as to thoſe, <hi>Manus Dominae Reginae amoveantur,</hi> and that upon the Statute of 29 <hi>Eliz. cap</hi> 5. concerning Recuſants: <hi>viz.</hi> that upon default of payment of penalties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which proceſs iſſued out of the Exchequer to take and ſeize all the goods, and two parts as well of all the Lands, Tenements and Hereditaments, Leaſes and Farms of ſuch Offender, as of all other the Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, liable to ſuch ſeiſure, or to the penalties aforeſaid, by the true meaning of this Act, leaving the third part, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Popham</hi> Attorney General moved, If a Recuſant hath more than a third part of his Lands in Copy-hold land, if this Copy-hold as to the ſurpluſage ſhall be liable to the penalty. <hi>Manwood</hi> chief Baron conceived, that the Copy-hold is liable in this Caſe by the Statute, although not directly by expreſs words, yet within the intent of it, and that by reaſon of theſe words all other the lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> liable to ſuch ſeiſure, <hi>&amp;c. Walmeſ.</hi> Serjeant, Copy-hold is not liable to a Statute Merchant or Staple; alſo if the Queen hath the Copy-hold, how ſhall the Lord have the ſervices which the Queen cannot do? Alſo a Copy-hold is not an Hereditament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Statute, which extends only to Hereditaments at the common Law, and not by cuſtom: Alſo in Acts of Parliaments which are enacted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53034:56"/>
for forfeiture of Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, by thoſe words they ſhall not forfeit Copy-holds. <hi>Clark</hi> Baron, this Statute was made to reſtrain Recuſants from taking the benefit of their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and Copy-holds are their Livings as well as Free-holds, and by this Statute, the Queen ſhall not have every eſtate in the Copy-hold Land, but only the taking of the profits; but the ſcope of the Statute was to impair the Livings of Recuſants, and that by driving of them for want of maintenance to repair to the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> If the Statute had given to the Queen to ſeiſe two parts of their livings, then the Statute had extended to Copy-holds. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> when a Statute is made to transfer an eſtate by name of Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, the Copy-hold is not within ſuch Statute; but if the Lords Signiory, his Cuſtoms and Services, are not to be impeached, or taken away by ſuch Statute, then it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for ſuch Statute doth not make another Tenant to the Lord; And by him Copy-holder ſhall pay Subſidies, and he ſhall be aſſeſſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the value of his Copy-hold as well as of his Freehold, and in this Caſe, the Queen is to have the profits of the Lands only, but no eſtate. At another day, the caſe was argued for the Recuſants by <hi>Snag</hi> Serjeant, and he ſaid, that theſe words Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments are to be conſtrued, which are ſuch at the Common Law, not by Cuſtom: If I give to one all my Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments in <hi>D.</hi> my Copy-holds do not paſs, and Statutes which are made to take away Poſſeſſions and Hereditaments out of perſons ought to be ſtrictly taken, and not by Equity: The Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of Bankrupts enacts, that the Commiſſioners may ſell the Lands and Tenements of the Bankrupts; if the Statute had not made a further proviſion, the Commiſſioners could not ſell Copy-hold Lands, but there are expreſs words in the Statute for that purpoſe, <hi>i.e.</hi> as well copy as fee: Alſo the Staute of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 4. of Auditors and Receivers of the Queen doth not extend to Copy-holds: And it ſhould be a great prejudice to the Lords of ſuch Copy-holds, that the Queen ſhould have the Land. <hi>Popham,</hi> the intention of the Law ſomtimes cauſes a liberal conſtruction of a Statute in the letter of it,<note place="margin">What Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes extend to Copy-holds.</note> ſomtimes a ſtrict and preciſe expoſition, and here it appeareth, that the intention of the Statute was, that the Queen ſhould have all the goods of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and two parts of the Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Leaſes and Farms, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant but the third part of all his Lands only; And therefore the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſant is not to have any other thing but only that which is allotted to him by the Statute, and that is the third part, which is all the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which the Law allows him; and then if Copy-holds be not within this Statute, a Recuſant who hath great poſſeſſions in Copy-holds, and hath no Free-hold ſhould be diſpuniſhable, and hath his full main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, againſt the meaning of the Statute: And he ſaid that many things are within the meaning of a Statute,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">5 Co. 124.</note> and contention may be as well for Copy-hold as for Land at the common Law. One hath a Leaſe for years to begin at a day to come, he who hath the Free-hold thereof is diſſeiſed, the Diſſeiſor levieth a Fine, five years paſs, he who hath the Free-hold is bound by it, but not he who hath the Intereſt for years in <hi>futuro,</hi> as it hath been lately adjudged; But he ſaid, That if that point were to be handled again, the Law would be taken to the contrary; but it is clear that a Leaſe in poſſeſſion ſhall be bound by ſuch Fine: And as unto any prejudice to the Lord it is clear, that notwithſtanding that the Queen hath the Copy-hold Land, yet the Lord ſhall have the Rent during the poſſeſſion of the Queen, which is the moſt valuable part of the ſervices of the Copy-holder. The Statute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 6. of Chantries, doth extend to Copy-hold, by the general words, Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Proviſo which excepts Copy-holds were not neceſſary: And in our Statute, the words are Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments, which are forceable words, which proves that our expoſition to extend it to Copy-holds is proper and agreeable to the Statute, and this in the firſt branch of it; for Copy-hold is ſome Land, Tenement, or Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditament; the clauſe in this branch of the Statute is, and alſo all other the Lands, Tenements, and Hereditaments liable to ſuch ſeiſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſame is to be meant of ſuch Lands which are bound with clauſe of revocation, of which is ſpoken in the former part of this Statute.

The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors paying to the Creditors of the Teſtator a Debt with their own goods, they may retain ſo much of the goods of the Teſtator; but that caſe is not like to this, for here the Executors have not made any pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or ſatisfaction of the Debt, nor disburſed any mony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor other things, but only have made an Obligation, to pay a ſum of mony at a day to come, before which day it may happen that the Obligation be cancelled or releaſed; but it may more fitly be compared to the caſe of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. where an Executor had compounded with a Creditor of the Teſtator for the payment of 20 <hi>l.</hi> for a debt of 40 <hi>l.</hi> and had an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance teſtifying the payment of the 40 <hi>l.</hi> where it was holden, that the other 20 <hi>l.</hi> is Aſſets. And by <hi>Rhodes,</hi> this making of an Obligation by Executors,<note place="margin">Adminiſtration. Aſſets.</note> (although the Obligation, in which the Teſtator was boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, be delivered to the Executors and cancelled) is not any admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration nor payment of the ſaid debt due: So if the Executors pledge the goods for the payment of ſuch a debt, yet they ſhall be accounted Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets until payment be made, which <hi>Periam</hi> denied. And <hi>Periam</hi> and all the other Iuſtices held clearly,<note place="margin">Retainer by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations.</note> that if in ſuch caſe the Executors make a ſufficient Obligation to the Creditor of the Teſtator, and ſufficiently diſcharge the Teſtator without fraud or covin, that they may retain the goods of the Teſtator for ſo much: and the goods retained ſhall not be ſaid Aſſets: And this caſe is all one with the caſe of 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. for here they have diſcharged the Teſtator, and the Executors do remain charged with the ſame to the Creditor; and it is ſo fully adminiſtred, as if the Executors had expreſly paid the debt. And it is not like to the caſe of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. cited before, for there, although they have diſcharged the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, yet they have not charged themſelves, otherwiſe it is in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal caſe; and although they have appointed <hi>ulteriorem diem,</hi> for the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſaid debt, yet the ſame is not material: But the Lord <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon</hi> conceived, that if the Creditor doth deliver unto the Executors the Obligation as an Accquittance or diſcharge, and in conſideration thereof they promiſe to pay the debt, the ſame is not any adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to the ſaid debt. And by ſome of the Serjants, If the plea ſtand good to prove fully adminiſtred, then Executors in ſuch caſe may make an Obligation to pay the debt 40 years after, and ſo defraud the other Creditors, which is not reaſonable: If a Feoffment in Fee made upon condition to pay certain mony at ſuch a day, and at the day the Feoffees make an Obligation to the Feoffor for the payment of it, the ſame is no performance of the condition. And by <hi>Periam,</hi> If the Executor be taken in Execution for the debt of the Teſtator, he may retain ſo much of the goods of the Teſtator amounting to the ſum for which he is in Execution, and it ſhall be accounted Aſſets in his hands. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> If he to whom the Teſtator was endebted in 20 <hi>l.</hi> be endebted to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in ſo much, and the Executor in ſatisfaction of the debt of the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator releaſeth his debt, the property ſhall be altered preſently of the whole goods in the hands of the Executors, ſo where the Debtor makes the Creditor his Executor.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:53034:64"/>

As if a Feme Covert be bound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Obligee bring her into the Chancery, and if a man threaten me, that if I will not pay to him ten pounds, he will ſue me in Chancery, upon which I promiſe to pay it him, no Action will lye: And an Infant is not chargeable upon any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, but for his meat, drink, and neceſſary Apparel, 19 <hi>Z.</hi> 4. 2.

to the whole, for nothing paſſeth from the Husband, but he is named with his Wife only for conformity, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 19. <hi>A.</hi> takes to Wife an Inheretrir, who is attainted of Felony, the King ſhall not have the Land preſently, by which it appeareth that all is in the Wife, and ſhe ſhall be reſtored to the whole, and the Iudgment ſhall be according to the Preſidents cited before: And as to the Preſident cited 7 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the ſame is not to the purpoſe, for the ſecond Husband was a ſtranger to the Fine, for it would be abſurd to reverſe the Fine as againſt him. <hi>Egerton</hi> Solicitor General; Preſidents are not ſo holy, <hi>quod violari non debeant,</hi> as to be rules to other Iudges, <hi>in perpetuum;</hi> and I conceive that the Fine ſhall be reverſed as to the Wife only, for the Fine is but a Conveyance, and the Husband may lawfully convey the Land of his Wife for his life; and if the Husband alone had levyed the Fine, the ſame had bounden the Wife during his life: If a woman Leſſee for life taketh to Husband him in the Reverſion, and they joyn in a Fine, the Fine ſhall ſtand as to the Inheritance of the Husband, but ſhall be reverſed as to the Intereſt of the Wife. <hi>Coke,</hi> it ſhall be intended here, all the Intereſt and eſtate in the Land to be in the Wife, as 20 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. Where the Husband and Wife are vouched, it ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by reaſon of the Warranty of the Wife only, and ſo the Counter-plea ſhall be of the ſeiſin of the Wife and her Anceſtors. <hi>Wray,</hi> when the Husband and Wife joyn in the Fine, it ſhall be preſumed the Inheritance of the Wife, and if it be otherwiſe, it ought to be ſpecially ſhewed; and as to that which hath been ſaid, that if the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band alone had levyed a Fine, it ſhould have bounden the Wife dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the life of the Husband, the ſame is true, but ſuch Fine is but a diſcontinuance, but the right continueth in the Wife; but when the Husband and Wife joyn in the Fine, all paſſeth out of her, and if the Fine in ſuch caſe for the Inheritance ſhall be reverſed in all, to whom belongs the Free-hold, &amp; to whom ſhall he be attendant? <hi>Gawdy,</hi> 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1. In a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> againſt three, they vouch ſeverally, the Voucher was not received, and yet they might have ſeveral Cauſes of Voucher, but the Law preſumes they are Ioynt-tenants, and have a joynt cauſe of Voucher, if the contrary be not ſhewed: And afterwards Iudgment was given, <hi>quod finis predict. reverſetur;</hi> and <hi>Wray</hi> ſaid he had conferred with many of the other Iuſtices, who were of the ſame opinion. <hi>Gawdy,</hi> the Fine ſhall be reverſed in all, for this is an Error in Law of the Court, <hi>F. B.</hi> 21. <hi>D.</hi> For by this Fine the Husband giveth nothing divided from the eſtate of the Wife, but all paſſeth from the Wife, and therefore all ſhall be reverſed, and if the Fine ſhould be reverſed as to the Wife only, then the Fine levyed now by the Husband alone is a diſcontinuance, by which the Wife by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law ſhall be put to her <hi>Cui in vita,</hi> and that is not reaſon. Alſo we cannot by this Reverſal, make the Conuſee to have a particular eſtate during the life of the Wife: And therefore the Fine is to be reverſed for the whole, and as void for the whole to the Conuſee.</p>

He hath declared, that the ſaid <hi>Alice Leigh</hi> hath accepted the Rents of the ſaid two houſes, by reaſon of the reverſion, <hi>&amp; virtue teſtament. praedict.</hi> by 7 years, which is double and treble; for acceptance of a Rent at one day, <hi>ſcil.</hi> one rent day is a ſufficient election: As if the Iſſue in tail, after the death of his Anceſtor, who hath made a Leaſe not warranted by the Statute, once accepts the Rent, the Leaſe is affirmed; but if in plea pleading, the acceptance of the ſaid Rent for 3 years be pleaded, the ſame clearly is not good; for no good Iſſue can be taken thereupon. 2. This acceptance is not pleaded (as the Law wills) and in the phraſe of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> to which deviſe ſhe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, but pleads the acceptance of the Rent, which is matter of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the which is not good pleading. As 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 1.

But if <hi>Alice</hi> had not notice of the Deviſe, but dieth before notice, the ſame amounteth unto a diſagreement. And as to the pleading of the Agreement, I conceive its well enough pleaded, for if the Leaſe had not been ſhe might have entred, and then if ſuch Entry had been pleaded it had been good enough; and then becauſe ſhe could not enter by reaſon of the ſaid Leaſe, ſhe hath taken the rents and profits which is an actual agreement, and as ſtrong as an Entry.

                  <note place="margin">Aſſent not to be apportioned.</note> of which the Deviſor died ſeiſed in poſſeſſion, and that is a ſufficient agreement for the whole, for it is an entire Legacy.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:53034:72"/>
for thereby the Mayor may take Recognizances of Idiots, men of <hi>Non ſanae Memoriae, &amp;c.</hi> nor is it reſtrained to any perſons, or to any matters, but is too general, and therefore cannot be a good cuſtom. <hi>Gawdy,</hi> The Declaration is good notwithſtanding the Exception for want of averment, for that ought to come in on the other ſide. And as to the cuſtom I conceive it is not good, for it is hard, That they ſhould take Recognizances of all Perſons, and for all Cauſes which riſe out of the City, and through the whole Realm, as well as within the City: alſo none ſhall take a Recognizance, but a Iudge of Record, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizance cannot be taken by preſcription. As to the firſt Exception, <hi>Wray</hi> agreed with <hi>Gawdy;</hi> and as to the Cuſtom, he held the ſame to be good. For it hath been always allowed, and their cuſtoms are confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Act of Parliament which makes them good. But if the cuſtom be not confirmed by Parliament it is not good; alſo it is not an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable Cuſtom, for it is for the benefit of the Subjects to have ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity for their Debts. <hi>Coke,</hi> The Recognizance makes the Debt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and therefore 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>bar.</hi> 649. Debt was brought in <hi>London</hi> upon a Recognizance acknowledged in the Chancery at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and the Writ was abated; for the Recognizance makes it local there; and by him the cuſtom ſtands with reaſon: The Mayor is ſuch a perſon who may take a Recognizance, for he is a Iudge of Record. See 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 20. and <hi>Br.</hi> Recognizance 8. and the Recogniſee cannot have an Action of Debt upon this Recognizance elſewhere than in <hi>London.</hi> For it is not a Debt out of the Iurisdiction of the Court, for the Recognizance hath made it local. <hi>Wray,</hi> If the Recogniſor be within age, the ſame ſhall come in of the other ſide, and the Plaintiff needs not ſhew the ſame in his Declaration. <hi>Cooke,</hi> It was agreed betwixt <hi>Mabbe</hi> and <hi>Frend,</hi> That ſuch a Recognizance was good. <hi>Tanfield,</hi> The ſaid Recognizance was taken for Orphans goods which is a thing within their Iurisdiction. <hi>Clench,</hi> They of <hi>London</hi> cannot take Recognizance of more than they can hold plea of it. <hi>Wray,</hi> They have uſed of long time to take Recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zances, and their cuſtoms are confirmed by Parliament, and a more ſtrange cuſtom than this hath been allowed of here before, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That a feme Covert ſhall ſue an Action alone without her Husband, for ſhe is a ſole Merchant; Alſo they do certifie Recognizances <hi>ore tenus.

                  <hi>Pierce</hi> hath taken a falſe Oath in the Conſiſtory Court of the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and upon the Declaration, the Defendant did demur in Law.

And it was ruled in an action upon the caſe betwixt <hi>Dorrington</hi> and <hi>Dorrington,</hi> upon theſe words, Thou art a Baſtard, that an action lyeth, and yet Baſtardy is a ſpiritual matter, and there determinable; So for theſe words, Thou art a Pirate, an action lyeth, and yet Piracy is not puniſhable by the common Law, but in the Court of Admiralty.

frequent in the ſaid Eccleſiaſtical Court. <hi>Gawdy</hi> upon theſe words, an action doth not lye, for they are not pregnant of any perjury in the Pl. for he may be meer paſſive in it: for if one of the Maſters of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery</hi> miniſter an Oath unto any perſon, or any Commiſſioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Plaintiff ſweareth falſly, a man may ſay, That the Maſter of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> or the Commiſſioner hath taken a falſe oath, and yet he is not guilty of falſity. And afterwards <hi>Wray, mutata opinione,</hi> That the Proviſo in the ſaid Statute, is to this intent, That notwithſtanding the ſaid Statute, ſuch an offence may be enquirable and examined in the Eccleſiaſtical Court in ſuch manner as it was before, but the ſame doth not take away or reſtrain the authority of the Common Law, but that ſuch an offence may be here examined. And it hath been lately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> That ſuch perjury was examinable there, for it is not reſtrained: and as to the latter exception, upon theſe words (he hath taken a falſe oath) it ſhall be intended actively, and not paſſively, and if ſo, the Defendant ought to have ſo pleaded it, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

                  <hi>LIttleton</hi> brought Debt upon an Obligation againſt <hi>Humphry Pernes,</hi> who pleaded, that the ſaid Obligation was endorced with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, for the performance of certain Articles and Covenants contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in certain Indentures, by which Indentures the Plaintiff firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted, that <hi>Edward</hi> brother of <hi>Humphry</hi> ſhould enjoy ſuch Land until the Feaſt of <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next following, rendring ſuch Rent at the end of the ſaid Term: and the ſaid <hi>Humphry</hi> covenanted, that the ſaid <hi>Edward</hi> at the Feaſt aforeſaid ſhould ſurrender quietly and peaceably the ſaid Lands to the Plaintiff, and that the ſaid Plaintiff to ſuch of the ſaid Lands as by the Cuſtom of the Country, <hi>tunc jacebant friſca,</hi> ſhould have in the mean time free ingreſs, egreſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at his will and pleaſure, with his ſervants, ploughs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as to that Covenant, the Defendant pleaded, <hi>Quod permiſit querentem habere intrationem &amp; exitum, &amp;c. in tales terras, quales tunc jace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant ſecundum conſuetudinem patriae, &amp;c.</hi> And Exception was taken to this plea, becauſe he hath not ſhewed in certain, which Lands they were which then then did lie Frecy, according to the cuſtom of the Country; which <hi>Anderſon</hi> allowed of, but <hi>Walmſly</hi> ſtrongly inſiſted to the contrary: And he confeſſed, that where an Act is to be done, according to a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, he who pleads the performance of it ought to plead it ſpecially; but as our caſe is, here is no Act to be done, but a permittance as above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and it is in the Negative, not a diſturbance, in which caſe <hi>permiſit</hi> is a good plea; and then it ſhall come on the other ſide on the Plaintiffs part, to ſhew in what Lands the Defendant <hi>non permiſit:</hi> Which differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſee agreed, 17 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 26. by the whole Court.

his Sheep with the Sheep of the Defendant for the day time, that it was lawful at night to take all the Sheep and put them in his fold all the night, and in the morning to put them out, and the ſame was holden a good preſcription, for which the Plaintiff traverſed the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription: And for the other ſee 11 <hi>H</hi> 7. 13, 14. 21 <hi>H</hi> 7. 40. betwixt Lord and Tenant, that every Tenant for every pound-breach ſhould forfeit three pounds; and ſee the Prior of <hi>Dunſtables</hi> caſe, 11 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 19. <hi>Br.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription 98.

And the ſame was holden a good preſcription.

If I have an acre of Land adjoyning to your acre, and my acre is drowned, I may make a ſluce to carry away the water, and although that by ſo doing your acre is drowned, yet I ſhall not be puniſhed for it, becauſe it is lawful for me to make a trench in my own Land, and then if it be any <hi>Nuſance</hi> to you, you may make a trench in your ground, and ſo carry away the water until it come to a River or ditch.

If one erect a Mill neer to my Mill, no Action lieth againſt him, for it is for the uſe of the Kings Subjects, and God forbid, that Bread and the baking of it ſhould be reſtrained to any ſpecial perſon, eſpecially in a Market Town. And as to the caſe of the Prior of <hi>Dunſtable,</hi> that is not to the purpoſe, for there he preſcribed to have a Market and the correction of it; and the fault there is not in the uſurping of a Market in <hi>Nuſance</hi> of the Plaintiff, but becauſe the Defendant ſold meat there ſecretly, ſo as the Plaintiff could not have the correction of it. See 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 14. And it is not reaſonable, that ſuch profits be reſtrained and drawn from the publick good to the private commodity of any perſon.

                  <hi>MArſh</hi> brought an Action upon the Caſe againſt <hi>Aſtrey,</hi> and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he had procured a Writ of Entry <hi>ſur diſſeiſin</hi> againſt one <hi>A.</hi> and thereupon had a ſummons for Lands in <hi>London,</hi> and delivered the ſaid Summons to <hi>Aſtrey</hi> being Vnder-Sheriff of the ſame County; <hi>virtute cujus,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Aſtrey</hi> ſummoned the ſaid <hi>A.</hi> upon the Land, but notwithſtanding that did not return the ſaid Summons. <hi>Aſtrey</hi> pleaded Not guilty; And it was tryed in <hi>London,</hi> where the action was brought for the Plaintiff; and it was moved by <hi>Cook</hi> in arreſt of Iudgment, That here is a miſ-trial, for this iſſue ought to be tryed in the County where the Land is, becauſe that the cauſe is local; but the Exception was not allowed, for the action is well layed in <hi>London,</hi> and ſo the trial there alſo is good.<note place="margin">Trial.</note> Another Exception was moved becauſe the action ought to be againſt the Sheriff himſelf, and not againſt the Vnder-Sheriff, for the Sheriff is the Officer to the Court, and all Returns are in his Name; and I grant that an action for any falſity or deceit lyeth againſt the Vnder-Sheriff, as for embeſſeling, raſing of Writs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but upon <hi>Non feaſans,</hi> as the Caſe is here, the not Retorn of the Summons, it ought to be brought againſt the Sheriff himſelf. See 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 12. And if the Vnder-Sheriff take one in Execution, and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to eſcape, debt lyeth againſt the Sheriff himſelf. Another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was taken becauſe the Declaration is that the ſaid <hi>Aſtrey In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendens &amp; machinans ipſum querent. in actione ſua praedict. proſequend. impedire, &amp;c.</hi> did not retorn the ſaid Summons, but doth not ſay, <hi>tunc exiſt.</hi> Vnder-Sheriff. <hi>Snag,</hi> contrary, If a Baily Errant of the Sheriff, take one in Execution, and he ſuffer him to eſcape, an action lieth againſt the Baily himſelf. And that was agreed in the Caſe of a Baily of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex,</hi> and Sir <hi>Richard Dyer</hi> Sheriff of <hi>Huntington,</hi> and his Vnder-She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, who ſuffered a Priſoner to eſcape, &amp; the action was brought againſt the Vnder-Sheriff; for it may be the Sheriff himſelf had not notice of the matter, becauſe the Writ was delivered to the Vnder-Sheriff, and he took a Fee for it, and therefore it is reaſon that he ſhall be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. As if a Clerk in an Office miſ-enter any thing, he himſelf ſhall be puniſhed, and not the Maſter of the Office, becauſe he takes a fee for it. But if the Retorn made by the Baily be inſufficient, Then the Sheriff himſelf ſhall be amerced; but in the principal caſe it is clear, That the action lieth againſt the Vnder-Sheriff if the party will, and ſuch was the opinion of <hi>Gawdy</hi> and <hi>Clench:</hi> As to the other matter, becauſe it is not alledged in the Declaration, That the Defendant was Vnder-Sheriff at the time, the Declaration is good enough not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that, for ſo are all the Preſidents, and if the Defendant were not Vnder-Sheriff the ſame ſhall come in of the other ſide. See 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 23. And afterwards in the principal Caſe, Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

Sir <hi>John Greſham</hi> dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham</hi> his ſon built a new Houſe upon the Land, and, 4 <hi>Mariae,</hi> leaſed to <hi>Bellingford</hi> for one and twenty years, rendring the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Rent. And afterwards 2 <hi>Eliz.</hi> he levyed a fine of the ſaid Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours and of all his Lands: and 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> he made a Iointure to his Wife in this manner, <hi>ſci.</hi> He covenanted with certain perſons to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of himſelf, and his Wife for their lives, and afterwards to the uſe of his Right Heirs, and afterwards, 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> he leaſed unto <hi>Read</hi> and his wife for one and twenty years to begin preſently (which was a year before the expiration of the ſaid Leaſe made unto <hi>Bellingford;</hi>) which Leaſe being expired, <hi>Read</hi> entred. It was argued by <hi>Cook,</hi> That here, upon the words contained in the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had power and authority, not being but Tenant for life, to make a Leaſe for years, or Iointure, and that upon implication of the Will, which ought to be taken &amp; conſtrued according to the intent of the parties; for his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was to give a power, as well as an eſtate, otherwiſe the word <hi>(o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe)</hi> ſhould be void; and it is to be obſerved, That the parties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed in the ſaid conveyance were Knights, and it is not very likely, That the ſaid Sir <hi>Richard Greſham</hi> did intend, that they ſhould keep the Lands in their own manurance as Husbandmen, but ſet the ſame to Farm for Rent.

that the order of his Inheritance ſhould be preſerved, yet to make a Proviſion for Iointure; and it is great reaſon and cauſe to his family to enable and make them capable of great Matches, which ſhould be a ſtrengthning to his poſterity, which could not be without great Ioin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherefore I conceive it reaſonable to conſtrue it ſo, That here they have power to make Iointures for their Wives. It hath been ſaid, That no grant can be taken by implication, as 12 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Tit. Avow.</hi> 77.

(and there is no difference) as ſome conceive (when the deviſe is to the heir, and when to a ſtranger) but theſe caſes concern matter of Intereſt, but our caſe concerns an Authority: And admit that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> hath power and authority to make this leaſe, Then we are to conſider if the Iointure be good, for if it be, Then being made before the Leaſe,<note place="margin">Uſe cannot riſe out of a power.</note> it ſhall take effect before, and the woman Iointreſs is found to be alive.

A man deviſeth, That his Executors ſhall ſell his reverſion, and they ſell by Word, it is a good Sale, for now the Reverſion paſſeth by the Will. But an uſe cannot be raiſed out of an uſe, and a man cannot bargain, and ſell Land to another uſe than of the Bargainee. And it is like unto the caſe of 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4, 5. The diſſeiſee doth releaſe unto the diſſeiſor ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring Rent, the render is void, for a rent cannot iſſue out of a right, ſo an uſe cannot be out of a Releaſe by the diſſeiſee, for ſuch releaſe to ſuch purpoſe ſhall not enure as an Entry and Feoffment: Alſo here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that conveyance Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> hath built and erected a New houſe, and no new Rent is reſerved upon it, and therefore here it is not the ancient Rent, for part of the ſum is going out of the new houſe.

                  <hi>Wray,</hi> It is but one Statute, and therefore it ſhall be conſtrued with one conſtruction, and it ſhould be a ſtrange conſtruction, that the King ſhould be within one part of the Statute, and out of the other. And 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 3. The Kings Attorney could not have damages, which is a great proof and authority, that the Iudgment for damages in ſuch caſe is Error: The experience and uſage of Law is ſufficient to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the ſame to us, and from the time of <hi>E.</hi> 3. until now, no damages have been given in ſuch caſe.

                  <hi>WAlmeſley</hi> Serjeant demanded the opinion of the Court upon this matter. Land is given to Husband and Wife in ſpecial tail (during the Coverture) they have iſſue, the Husband is attainted of Treaſon and dieth, the Wife continues in as Tenant in tail, the iſſue is reſtored by Parliament, and made inheritable to his Father, ſaving unto the King all advantages which were devolded unto him by the Attainder of his Father, the Wife dieth. And he conceived, that the iſſue was inheritable, for the Attainder which diſturbed the inheritance is removed, and the blood is reſtored, and nothing can accrue to the King, for the Father had not any eſtate forfeitable, but all the eſtate did ſurvive to the Wife, not impeachable by the ſaid Attainder.

                  </gap>rm and by the name aforeſaid, be a good Leaſe, was all the queſtion. And this matter was argued, and many times debated in the Exchequer, as well at the Bench as at the Bar. And it was agreed by <hi>Clerk</hi> and <hi>Gent,</hi> Barons there, That the ſaid Leaſe made to the Defendant was utterly void by reaſon of the Miſnoſmer. <hi>Manwood</hi> argued ſtrongly to the contrary; and Iudment was given for the Plaintiff, according to the opinions of the ſaid two Barons: Vpon which the Defendant brought a Writ of Error in the Exchequer-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber before the Lord Chancellor, Treaſurer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now this Term it was argued by <hi>Godfrey</hi> on the part of the Defendant: Three vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances have been ſuppoſed in this Leaſe from the Original Foundation of the Hoſpital in the name of it. 1. The name of the Foundation is the Maſter of the Hoſpital, <hi>&amp;c. Et Capellani dict. Hoſpitii;</hi> So that in the Leaſe reſts part of the name <hi>(Capellani)</hi> as not immediately annexed to Maſter, as it is in the name of the Foundation. But as to that point, the Iuſtices Aſſiſtants delivered <hi>Godfrey</hi> from the arguing of it, as of a variance not material: Another variance hath been object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe that in the Foundation the words are <hi>Hoſpitalis Regis H.</hi> 7. and in the Leaſe the words are, <hi>Hoſpitalis Henrici ſeptimi nuper Regis Angliae,</hi> ſo as this word <hi>(Nuper)</hi> is Surpluſage, and <hi>ex abundant.</hi> But of that matter he was alſo diſcharged, becauſe it is no variance in ſubſtance: But all the difficulty reſted in this, that in the Foundation the words are <hi>(de le Savoy)</hi> and in the Leaſe <hi>(vocat. le Savoy)</hi> And he put the Caſe 4 <hi>Mar. Dyer</hi> 150. The Colledge of <hi>Eaton</hi> was incorporated by the name of <hi>Praepoſiti &amp; Collegii regalis S. Mariae de Eaton juxta Windſor,</hi> and a Leaſe is made by the name <hi>Praepoſiti &amp; Sociorum Collegii regalis de Eaton,</hi> and that was holden a void Leaſe: And I confeſs that in the names of Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, we ought to reſort to the Foundation of the Corporations, for the name of a Corporation is as a name of Baptiſm, &amp; ought to be as preciſely obſerved, but that ought to be intended in matter of ſubſtance, &amp; not otherwiſe, <hi>vide</hi> 10 <hi>Eliz.

Trin. in Cant. et totum Capit. de Eccleſia praedict.</hi> And the ſame was holden a good Leaſe, notwithſtanding that variance, which is not in ſubſtance of the name. And the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Peterborow</hi> was incorporated by the name of <hi>Decanus et Capitul. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae Petriburgenſis,</hi> and they made a Leaſe by the name <hi>Decanus et Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulum Eccleſiae de Peterborow,</hi> and holden good enough, becauſe the variance was not in any matter of ſubſtance: And he cited the Caſe betwixt <hi>Croft</hi> and <hi>Howel,</hi> 20 <hi>Eliz. Plow. Com.</hi> 537. The Cooks of <hi>London</hi> were incorporated by the name of Maſters, and Governors,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:53034:87"/>
and Commonalty of the Miſtery of Cooks, and they by the Name of Maſter and Wardens of the ſaid Craft and Miſtery of Cooks made a Conveyance, and it was holden that the variance aſſigned in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of this word <hi>(Craft)</hi> in the Conveyance, which was not in this Corporation, was not any material variance, but only matter of ſurpluſage, for <hi>(Craft)</hi> and <hi>(Myſtery)</hi> are all one, and of one ſenſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo in the principal Caſe, The <hi>Hoſpital de le Savoy,</hi> and the <hi>Hoſpital vocat. le Savoy,</hi> ſound the ſame, and in effect do not differ. And as it was ſaid by the Lord Chief Baron in his Argument in the Court of <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> in this caſe, four things are only to be reſpected in the Name of a Corporation:<note place="margin">Poſt. 162, 164.</note> Firſt the Name of the living perſons who are the Corporation, as in our Caſe the Maſter and Chaplains: Secondly, the houſe in which they are reſident, and make their aboad: Thirdly, The Name of the Founder: Fourthly, the place upon which the place of their aboad is built and erected. And if theſe four matters are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ſet down, although not formally, it is good enough. It hath been objected, That the <hi>Hoſpital de le Savoy,</hi> and the Hoſpital <hi>vocat. le Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> do much differ, for <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> implieth the demonſtration of the Place, but <hi>vocat. le Savoy,</hi> trencheth only to the Name, As if the Dean &amp; Chap. <hi>de Pauls in London,</hi> make a Leaſe by the Name of Dean and Chap. of St. <hi>Paul vocat. London,</hi> ſo if the Maſter and Fellows of <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge; in <hi>Cambridge</hi> make a Leaſe by the Name of Maſter &amp; Fellows of <hi>Trinity</hi> Coll. <hi>vocat. Cambridge,</hi> ſuch Leaſes are utterly void. I do well agree thoſe Caſes, for the Dean and Chapter is not all <hi>London,</hi> but part of <hi>London,</hi> and therefore cannot be called or ſaid <hi>London;</hi> and ſo <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge is but part of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and therefore cannot be called <hi>Cambridge;</hi> but here in our caſe, The Hoſpital is not parcel of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> but the whole <hi>Savoy</hi> is the Hoſpital, and there is not any part of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> which is not the Hoſpital; But if <hi>Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> make a Leaſe by the Name of Maſter and Fellows <hi>Collegii vocat. Trinity</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> it is a good Leaſe: And he put a difference, where the word in the Name of the Corporation, which precedes <hi>(de)</hi> is all one and of the ſame Nature with the word which follows <hi>(de)</hi> and where on the contrary, as in our caſe, The word which precedes <hi>(de)</hi> is Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and the words which follow <hi>(de)</hi> are <hi>le Savoy,</hi> are all one and the ſame thing, ſo as the Hoſpital and <hi>Savoy</hi> are all one and the ſame, and therefore may be well called <hi>Le Savoy,</hi> and alſo <hi>(de)</hi> and <hi>(vocat.)</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction are the ſame, &amp; ſo our Leaſe is good enough: And it is found by verdict, That this Hoſpital was erected upon the Manor of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and thereupon it is now commonly called <hi>Le Savoy,</hi> without any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Hoſpital, for as it was called <hi>Savoy</hi> before it was erected into an Hoſpital, ſo it is alſo called after the Erection; and true it is that the miſnaming of a Corporation in any ſmall thing ſhall abate a Writ, for there is only delay, yet it is not of force in a Conveyance, unleſs the miſnaming be in a point material. <hi>Coke</hi> to the contrary, The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance from the true Name of a Corporation which ſhall prejudice a Conveyance ought to be in matter of ſubſtance, for variance in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of form and circumſtance will not hurt it, <hi>ſed parum differunt quae re concordant.</hi> And firſt it is to be confeſſed, That the Name of a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is as the Name of Baptiſm, which admits of no variance, and therefore it is ſaid 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 15. by <hi>Knivet,</hi> when a Man founds a Chantry or a houſe, &amp;c. it ought to bear ſuch a Name as his Founder hath given to it, for that is its proper name. And ſo it hath been Reported by <hi>Bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes,</hi> Serjeant, 4 and 5 <hi>Phi.</hi> and <hi>Mar.</hi> That it was holden for a poſitive Law, by all the Iudges of <hi>England,</hi> That the miſtaking of the Name of a Corporation in any matter of Subſtance, makes the Conveyance ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void, for a name is given to a Corporation upon the Foundation, and that by the ſame Name they ſhall implead and be impleaded, but that <hi>ut idem nomen, et ſub eodem nomine ſint habiles ad perquirend. &amp; concedend.</hi> to be impleaded, and to implead, but that is to be meant <hi>idem re,</hi> for
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53034:87"/>
it is not neceſſary, that it be <hi>idem litera,</hi> for, <hi>qui haeret in litera haeret in Cortice,</hi> but if it be <hi>idem re</hi> with the Foundation it is well enough. And therefore it hath been adjudged, That where the Colledge is incorporated by the Name of Maſters and Fellows <hi>Collegii St. &amp; individ. Trin. in Canta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brig.</hi> and they make a Leaſe by the Name of <hi>Collegii Trin.</hi> this is good enough, for the word Trinity, implies, and imports <hi>St. &amp; individ.</hi> And therefore ſuch variance was holden not material. But here in our caſe is a variance in Subſtance, betwixt the Name given to the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital upon the foundation, and the name uſurped in the Leaſe. And the ſame will clearly appear upon my Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Name given to this Hoſpital upon the foundation of it, and the Name uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Leaſe be not <hi>unum in ſenſu</hi> (not in your private underſtanding as private perſons, but in your judicial knowledge upon the Record <hi>quod coram vobis reſidet,</hi> as Iudges of Record) then this leaſe is void; For although you as private perſons, otherwiſe than by Record, know, That the Hoſpital of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Hoſpital <hi>vocat. le Savoy,</hi> are all one Hoſpital; you ought not upon that your private knowledge to give Iudgment, unleſs alſo your judicial knowledge agree with it; that is, the knowledge which is out of the Records which you have before you: But if the Name given upon the Foundation, and the uſurped Name be not <hi>idem ſenſu</hi> in your Iudicial knowledge; and you cannot otherwiſe conceive the Identity of theſe two Hoſpitals, nor make any Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to imagine it but by the Record, for the Record is your eye of Iuſtice, and you have no other eye to look unto the cauſe depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you, but the Record; and to this purpoſe he cited the caſe of 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 108. Where a man killed another in the preſence of a Iudge tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veling on the way where the murther was, And at the next Aſſiſes in the ſaid County before the ſame Iudge, another man is indicted of the ſame murder, and arraigned, and convicted by verdict; In that caſe, The Iudge he ought not to carry himſelf according to his private knowledge, which he hath of the ſaid fact, <hi>ſci.</hi> to acquit the Priſoner, but all that he can do is to reſpite Iudgment againſt the party, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Iudges knowing to the contrary, and to make further Relation thereof to the King for his Pardon of grace for the Party. So in our Caſe, It may be that you in your private knowledge know, That the Hoſpital <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> and the Hoſpital <hi>vocat. le Savoy,</hi> is all one, but that doth not appear unto you upon the Record which is before you, but it may be for any thing that appears in the Record, that they are diverſe and ſeveral Hoſpitals; Therefore the Leaſe is void. To prove my Minor, I do ſay that this word <hi>(de)</hi> as here, <hi>de Savoy,</hi> deſignes a place, ſo as by this Word <hi>(de)</hi> the place is become parcel of the Name, but this word <hi>vocat. locum non denotat,</hi> but only the very name, and ſo here is a material difference and variance, for here by pretence of the Name in this Leaſe, there is not any place of the Corporation in the Name, but the Corporation is tranſitory, which cannot be, for a Corporation eſpecial conſiſting of many perſons, as <hi>Corpus aggregatum</hi> ought to have a certain place of their abiding, or otherwiſe it cannot be diſcerned by the Law, and it is but a Mathematical thing, and nothing elſe but a fiction, and they cannot be otherwiſe conſidered in Law, but as they are <hi>circumſcripti</hi> within the bounds of their houſe, and they cannot appear but by Attorney: and if a Prebend conſiſt upon a Manor, &amp; afterwards the Manor by Writ be demanded againſt the Prebend, and he loſe it, here he hath loſt his Name, becauſe he hath loſt that which giveth to him his Name, by Contrary by <hi>Blake,</hi> for his eſtate and place in the Chapter, doth remain unto him: And ſecondly, for another Cauſe here is a material variance, for this word <hi>(de)</hi> ſuppoſeth a place before the Foundation, as the place upon which the Hoſpital was erected was called <hi>Le Savoy</hi> before the Erection of it; but theſe words <hi>(vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. le Savoy)</hi> ſuppoſeth the ſame Name <hi>Savoy</hi> was impoſed upon the Foundation. Thirdly, theſe words <hi>(de le Savoy)</hi> do import the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:53034:88"/>
Hoſpital to be part of the place, which before the Foundation, was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Savoy,</hi> but <hi>vocat.</hi> trencheth only to all the place called <hi>Savoy:</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; <hi>(de le Savoy)</hi> is matter of certainty and verity; <hi>(vocat.)</hi> but matter of Reputation. And ſo for theſe four reaſons, great difference in ſubſtance appeareth betwixt the very name of the Hoſpital, and the Name uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the Leaſe. And he cited the Caſe 29 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Wingat.</hi> King <hi>E.</hi> 4. did incorporate the Dean and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of <hi>Windſor,</hi> by the Name of Dean and Cannons of the King and Queens Free Chappel of Saint <hi>George</hi> the Martyr within his Caſtle of <hi>Windſor;</hi> and made a Leaſe by another Name, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Name of Dean and Cannons of the King and Queens Free Chappel there, and the ſame Leaſe was made in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and it was hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den that the ſame was a variance in Subſtance. And he cited another Caſe 30 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Kings Bench betwixt <hi>Fiſher</hi> and <hi>Boys.</hi> A Colledge in <hi>Oxford</hi> was by Act of Parliament incorporated by the Name of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Scholars, <hi>Domus ſive Collegii Scholarium de Merton in univerſitate Oxoniae,</hi> and they make a Leaſe by the Name <hi>Cuſtos Domus ſive Collegii de Merton in Oxonia,</hi> and <hi>Scholares ejuſdum Domus,</hi> and the variance in that point, becauſe in the very name of the Foundation, <hi>Domus five Collegii Scholarium de Merton,</hi> and in the uſurped Name in the Leaſe <hi>Domus ſive Collegii de Merton,</hi> was holden material, and the true name was <hi>de Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in univerſitate Oxoniae,</hi> but in the Leaſe, <hi>in Oxonia</hi> only, leaving out the word Vniverſity, and the ſame was holden a variance in ſubſtance: For <hi>Oxford</hi> doth contain in it ſelf the Vniverſity, which is a thing of it ſelf, and alſo the City is a thing by it ſelf: and it may be that there is a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the City called <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge, and alſo a Colledge which is called by ſuch Name in the Vniverſity: and ſo in our Caſe, it may be that there is an Hoſpital which is called the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and alſo another which is <hi>Le Savoy,</hi> and then the Court ſhall be enveigled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the end of the Argument, the Lord Treaſurer, which was the Lord <hi>Burleigh,</hi> put this Caſe, which was adjudged in his time. The Guild of <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colnſhire,</hi> was incorporated by the Name of the Guild of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and our Lady the Virgin <hi>Mary, &amp;c.</hi> and they made a Leaſe for years by the Name of the Guild of our Lady the Virgin, and St. <hi>Nicholas, Religione quadam motus ut nomen Virginis Mariae, in charta dimiſſionis, proponere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur nomini Sancti Nicholai;</hi> and it was adjudged a void Leaſe for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance aforeſaid. And afterwards at another day, the matter was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> on the part of the Defendant. <hi>Starkey</hi> 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 56. ſaith, That the Name of the Corporation, by which it is incorporated, is as properly the Name of a Corporation, as the Name of Baptiſm is the Name of a ſingle and individual perſon, and yet there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the miſpriſion of them, for the Name of Baptiſm doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of one word, and therefore it cannot admit of any variance, but the name of a Corporation doth conſiſt of many words: in which caſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance in words which are ſupplyed by other words, and not in matter of ſubſtance, ſhall not hurt; and that hearing is notably diſcuſſed in the caſe of the <hi>Cooks</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> cited before by <hi>Godfrey.</hi> Four things are to be conſidered in the Name of a Corporation, which are of the Eſſence and Subſtance of it: Firſt, the perſons incorporated, of which the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth conſiſt, as here the Maſter and Chaplains <hi>de Savoy.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The quality of the Corporation, as Dean and Chapter, Mayor and Commonalty: Thirdly, the Patron or Founder, as, <hi>Merton</hi> Colledge; Fourthly, The Place whereupon the Corporation is founded. As to this laſt point, ſee 31 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 28. and <hi>fo.</hi> 15 by <hi>Knivet;</hi> and ſee 6 <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> King <hi>H.</hi> 8. erected the Dean and Prebend of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> by theſe words, <hi>ſcil. Decanus et Capit. Cathedralis Eccleſiae Chriſti, et Sanctae Mariae Virginis Ceſtriae.</hi> And afterwards by Letters Patents, gave to the ſaid Dean and Chapter, certain Manors, <hi>Decano et Capitulo Eccleſiae Cathedralis Chriſti et Sanctae Mariae Virginis,</hi> by us before erected, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53034:88"/>
that grant was holden void, becauſe that the place where, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not expreſſed in the ſaid Letters Patents, for <hi>Ceſtria</hi> is the local place of the Incorporation. And as to the Objection made upon the word <hi>(de)</hi> that this word <hi>(de)</hi> goeth only to part, and <hi>(vocat.)</hi> goes to the whole, and ſo here is a great difference; the ſame is not any reaſon, for this word <hi>(de)</hi> extends as well to the whole as to part. As a Rent granted <hi>percipiend. de Manerio de D.</hi> the ſame ſhall go to the whole Mannor, 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4, 5. <hi>ad reſpondendum I. Abbati Monaſterii Sanctae Mariae Ebor.</hi> where the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation was, <hi>Abbati Monaſterii Sanctae Mariae Virginis extra Muros Ebor.</hi> and yet the Writ was well enough, notwithſtanding ſuch variance, <hi>a forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ori,</hi> in the caſe of a conveyance and Intereſt. And I conceive that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in the Record, That the Leaſe given in evidence of the part of the Defendant, is a Leaſe made by the Maſter and Chaplains of the Hoſpital of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> for it is found by verdict, That King <hi>Henry the eighth,</hi> upon the Site of the Manour of <hi>Savoy,</hi> betwixt the houſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the houſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and that it was incorporated by the Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that afterwards <hi>Q. Mary</hi> by her Letters Patents, reciting the foundation of the ſaid Hoſpital cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and lamenting the Ruin of it, being ſurrendred in the time of <hi>E.</hi> 6. did reſtore it, by which it appeareth, That the Hoſpital of the <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Hoſpital called the <hi>Savoy</hi> is one and the ſame in reſpect of the Bounds, Foundation, and Situation. And in the whole courſe of our Books, no caſe can be found, That any Corporations have avoided their own acts, by ſuch cauſe of Miſnoſmer, nor of ſuch matter, is any queſtion moved in our Books. And as to that which hath been objected, That although the Iudges in their private knowledge well know, That the Houſe <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> and the Houſe <hi>vocat.</hi> the <hi>Savoy,</hi> be all one, yet they ought not to judge according to ſuch their private knowledge, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their judicial knowledge, which they have out of the Record. I conceive, That the Iudges of neceſſity ought to uſe in ſuch caſes their private knowledge; as where Miſnoſmer of a Colledge was objected, <hi>viz. Trinity Colledge</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where it was incorporated by the Name of Maſters, Fellows, and Scholars <hi>Collegii Sanctae &amp; individuae Trin.</hi> and they made a Leaſe by the Name of Maſter, Fellows, and Scholars of the Colledge of <hi>Trinity,</hi> the ſame was holden a good Leaſe, for the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges knew well enough, That this word <hi>Trinity</hi> doth imply in it ſelf <hi>Sancta &amp; individua,</hi> but by what knowledge? not by their judicial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but by their private knowledge; So in our caſe. <hi>Egerton</hi> the Queens Sollicitor to the contrary: It is a clear and plain Rule in our Law, That the name of a Corporation is as a name of Baptiſm to a natural man, and if there be any difference, I conceive, that the Law requires more ſtrict certainty in the name of a Corporation than in the Name of any particular perſon, For a name is more neceſſary to a Corporation than to another, for when an infant is born, he is preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a perfect creature, before any name given him, and the giving of the Name is not a matter of neceſſity, but of policy for diſtinction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but in the caſe of a Corporation, The Name is the ſubſtance and eſſence of it, and it is not a Body before a Name be impoſed upon it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Charters of Corporations there is always ſuch a clauſe, <hi>per tale nomen implacitare, &amp; implacitari, acquirere, &amp;c. poſſint,</hi> and without their Name, they are but a Trunk: but contrary in the caſe of particular perſons; Land is given <hi>primogenito filio J. S.</hi> It is a good gift, although there be no Name of Baptiſm: Lands given <hi>omnibus filiis J. S.</hi> is a good name of purchaſe, and if a man be bound in an obligation by a wrong or falſe Name, and in an action brought upon the ſame, if it appeareth upon evidence, that he was the ſame perſon which ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and delivered it, the ſame is ſufficient, and the Bond ſhall bind him. But contrary in the caſe of a Corporation, and we cannot give any thing to a Corporation by circumſtances, inducing or imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:53034:89"/>
their true name. As Land given to the firſt Hoſpital which the Queen ſhall found,<note place="margin">Ante. 161, 162.</note> although that it ſufficiently appear, That ſuch a one was the Hoſpital which the Queen firſt founded, yet the gift is void: And he denied, That the four things remembred before are neceſſarily required in the Name of a Corporation: for if the Queen will found a Corporation, as an Hoſpital by the Name of <hi>Utopia,</hi> the ſame is well enough without any reſpect of perſons, place, Founder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſet forth in the Charter. And alſo other things beſides the ſaid four things are ſometimes neceſſary in a Corporation; As if the Queen will found an Hoſpital by the Name, <hi>Quod fundavimus ad roga. Chriſt. Hatton Cancel. Angliae.</hi> all the ſame ought to be expreſſed in every grant made by, or to the ſaid Hoſpital; So <hi>Quod fundavimus ad relevandum pauperes;</hi> and ſometimes the number of the perſons incorporated, if it be in the Charter, it ought to be uſed in all acts made by or to them; As Maſter and ſir Chaplains; ſo as the ſaid four things recited before, are not ſo neceſſary in the Name of a Corporation, but ſo far forth as they are parcel of the Name given to them in the Charter of the Corporation: And in our caſe, 1. The place <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> is part of their name, ſet down in the Charter of their Corporation, and therefore the ſame ought to be preciſely follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And he relyed much upon the argument of <hi>Cook</hi> in noting material variances betwixt <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> and <hi>vocat. le Savoy,</hi> as <hi>(de)</hi> ſignifies part <hi>(vocat.)</hi> the whole; <hi>(de)</hi> ſignifies the place <hi>de facto, vocat.</hi> implyes reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only. There is a place near unto <hi>Whitehal</hi> called <hi>Scotland,</hi> becauſe that the Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> when they came to our Parliament uſed there to reſide, as the Lord Treaſurer affirmed. There is alſo a place in <hi>England</hi> called <hi>Normandy,</hi> and another called <hi>Callais,</hi> and alſo a place here in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> called <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but theſe, <hi>Scotland, &amp;c.</hi> but by Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, ſo as what difference is betwixt the very <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> here, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſuch and ſo much difference is there betwixt the Hoſpital <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> and the Hoſpital <hi>vocat.</hi> the <hi>Savoy.</hi> And as to that which hath been objected by <hi>Atkinſon,</hi> That that word <hi>(de)</hi> ſignifies as well the whole as part, as a Rent granted <hi>percipiend. de Manerio de D.</hi> I confeſs that this word <hi>(de)</hi> hath many ſignifications, ſo that we ought not only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what <hi>(de)</hi> ſignifyes of it ſelf, but rather to obſerve what goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what follows; for, as ſaith <hi>Hillary, intelligentia verborum ex cauſa di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendi ſumenda eſt.</hi> And this word <hi>(de)</hi> is a material word in the Name of a man, therefore alſo in the name of a Corporation, 26 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 31. Aſſiſe by <hi>I. de S.</hi> and it was found for him, and afterwards the Tenant in the Aſſiſe brought attaint, and in the reherſal of the Aſſiſe in the writ of attaint he was named <hi>I.S.</hi> leaving out <hi>(de)</hi> and for that cauſe the Writ did abate, 28 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 92. Debt brought by the Executor of <hi>John Holbech,</hi> where the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament was <hi>John de Holbech,</hi> and for want of this word <hi>(de)</hi> in the Writ, it was abated by Award. And in a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat</hi> againſt <hi>Mich. de Triage,</hi> he caſt a Protection for <hi>Michael Triage,</hi> leaving out <hi>(de)</hi> and for ſuch variance the Protection was diſallowed, and a <hi>Petit cape</hi> awarded. And although the Iudges in their private knowledge know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, That the Hoſpital <hi>de le Savoy,</hi> and the Hoſpital <hi>vocat.</hi> the <hi>Savoy,</hi> be all one, yet in point of Iudgment they ought not otherwiſe receive information, but out of the Record, and therefore, if ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be not within the Record to inform the Iudges of the Identity of the ſaid two Hoſpitals, their private knowledge ſhall not avail. And he cited the cauſe of the Lord <hi>Conniers,</hi> where the Parties being at iſſue, and the Iury charged for the trial of it; It was found by ſpecial ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, That a fine was levyed of the Lands in Queſtion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing found of the Proclamations, whereas in truth, the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were as well given in evidence as the fine, But found, <hi>Quod finis levatus fuit prout per recordum finis ipſius, in evidenciis oſtenſum, plenius apparet,</hi> Now in that caſe, although that the Iuſtices, knew well enough, That the Proclamations were expreſſly given in evidence, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53034:89"/>
it did not appear unto them as Iudges out of the Record, They would not give Iudgment, according to the truth of matter, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Record, for they cannot take notice if the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be in the Chirographers Office or not: But after it appeared unto them, That that defect was but a ſlip of the Clerk, they commanded the Record to be brought before them, and the Proclamation to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the verdict; and then gave Iudgment according to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict reformed as aforeſaid. And as to the Caſe of <hi>Martin</hi> Colledge cited before, he ſaid he was of Councel in it, and he knew, That the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there was not given for the cauſe alledged by <hi>Cook,</hi> but becauſe that this word, Scholars, was left out in the Leaſe. And he held, that if in the principal Caſe, the Leaſe had been, That the Maſter and Chaplains of the houſe called the Hoſpital of the <hi>Savoy, &amp;c.</hi> it had been well enough, for there is, <hi>de le Savoy.</hi> See a good caſe 36 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>fitz.

And afterwards the matter was compounded by the mediation of Friends: and <hi>Fanſhaw</hi> had the Leaſe for a certain ſum of mony.

And now it was moved for the Defendant, That upon the matter an action of Debt doth not lye againſt the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor or Adminiſtratrix; which was granted by the Court. But the doubt was, If now, foraſmuch as the Defendant by pleading the plea above, hath admitted the action, ſhe ſhall now take advantage of the Law in that point. For the reaſon why this action doth not lye againſt an Executor or Adminiſtrator is, becauſe the Teſtator himſelf might have waged his Law, if he had been impleaded upon it; and by intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Law the Executor or Adminiſtrator cannot have notice of ſuch a Debt, or of the diſcharge of it; But now by anſwering to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration as above, the Defendant hath taken notice of the Debt, and in manner confeſſed it.

Goldſ. 101, 102.</note>AN Information was in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> by <hi>John Slywright</hi> againſt <hi>Page,</hi> upon the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. of Maintenance; and declared that the Defendant took a Leaſe of one <hi>Joan Wade,</hi> of certain Lands, whereas the ſaid <hi>Joan</hi> was not ſeiſed nor poſſeſſed thereof according to the Statute; and upon Not guilty, the Iury found this ſpecial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That <hi>Edmund Wade</hi> was ſeiſed, and made a Feoffment in fee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of unto the uſe of himſelf, and of the ſaid <hi>Joan,</hi> who he then intended to marry, and the heirs of the ſaid <hi>Edmund.</hi> The marriage took effect, <hi>Edmund</hi> enfeoffed a Stranger, who entred, <hi>Edmund</hi> died, <hi>Joan</hi> not having had poſſeſſion of the ſaid Land after the death of <hi>Ed.</hi> her husband nor bing now in poſſeſſion, by Indenture demiſed the ſaid Land to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant for years, without any Entry or delivery of the Indenture upon the Land, The ſaid Defendant knowing the ſaid <hi>Joan</hi> never had been in poſſeſſion of the ſaid Land, and alſo the Defendant being Brother of the half blood to the ſaid <hi>Joan.</hi> The firſt Queſtion was, If the Leaſe being made by one out of poſſeſſion, and not ſealed or delivered upon the Land, and ſo not good in Law as to paſs any intereſt, be within the Statute aforeſaid. And the whole Court was clear of opinion that it was: for by colour of this pretended Leaſe, ſuch might be undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en &amp; advanced to the trouble &amp; diſquiet of the poſſeſſion, for amongſt the vulgar people, it is a Leaſe, &amp; it is a Leaſe by Reputation: Another matter was moved, becauſe that the entry of the wife is now made lawful by 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and then ſhe might well diſpoſe of the Land.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:53034:90"/>But as to that, It was ſaid by the whole Court, That the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Statute was to repreſs the practiſes of many, That when they thought they had title or right unto any Land, they for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance of their pretended Right conveyed their intereſt in ſome part thereof to great perſons, and with their countenance did oppreſs the poſſeſſors: And although here the Leaſe was made by the ſaid <hi>Joan</hi> to her Brother of the half blood, yet by the clear opinion of the Court the Leaſe is within the danger of the Statute, and yet in ſome Caſe the Son may maintain his Father, &amp; the Kinſman his Kinſman. And note in this caſe it was holden by the Iuſtices, That of neceſſity it ought to be found by verdict, That the Defendant knowing that the Leſſor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had been in poſſeſſion. And Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>IN an Action upon the Caſe, upon <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> by Sir <hi>Anthony Shirley</hi> againſt <hi>Albany.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aſſumpſit. 1 Cro. 150.</note> The Plaintiff declared, That he was ſeiſed of the Manor of <hi>Whittington</hi> for the term of his life, the Reverſion to the Earl of <hi>Arrundel</hi> in Fee, and ſo ſeiſed, ſurrendered all his Eſtate to the ſaid Earl, who afterwards by his Deed granted a Rent-charge of 40 <hi>l. per annum</hi> out of the ſaid Mannor to him, and afterwards conveyed the Manor to the Defendant in Fee. And afterwards, 27 <hi>Maii</hi> 22. <hi>Eliz.</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Communication betwixt the Plaintiff and the Defendant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſaid Rent; the Defendant did promiſe to the Plaintiff, that if the Plaintiff would ſhew unto the Defendant any Deed, by which it might appear that he ought to pay to the Plaintiff ſuch a Rent, he would pay that which is due, and that which ſhould be due from time to time. And further declared, that 27 <hi>April</hi> 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> he ſhewed unto the Defendant a Deed, by which it appeared that ſuch a Rent was granted, and due; And for eighty pounds due for the two laſt years, he brought the Action. The Defendant pleaded, that after the ſaid promiſe, and before the ſhewing of the ſaid Deed, <hi>ſcil.</hi> 14 <hi>Jan.</hi> 22 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Plaintiff entred into the ſaid Land, and leaſed the ſame for three years. The Plaintiff <hi>Replicando</hi> ſaid, that 1 <hi>Decem.</hi> 27 <hi>Eliz.</hi> the Defendant did re-enter, upon which they were at Iſſue, and it was found for the Plaintiff. It was moved by <hi>Glanvil</hi> Serjeant, that by the entry the Promiſe was ſuſpended, and being a perſonal thing once ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended, it is always extinct. <hi>Wray,</hi> The Action is brought for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerages due the two laſt years, and ſo at the time of his re-entry the Plaintiff had not cauſe of Action, and therefore it could not be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<note place="margin">Suſpenſion of Rent. Ante. 110.</note> 
                  <hi>Gawdy,</hi> When the Plaintiff ſheweth the Deed, the Defendant is chargable to arrerages due before and after the promiſe; wherefore if the entry maketh a ſuſpending of the Rent, the ſuſpenſion doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue: but I conceive here is not any ſuſpenſion, for this promiſe is a meer collateral thing, and ſo not diſcharged by the entry into the Land, for it is not iſſuing out of the Land. But if the Plaintiff before the Deed ſhewed had releaſed all Actions, the ſame had been a good Bar; and I conceive that the Deed was not ſhewed in time, for it ought to be ſhewn before any arrerages due after the promiſe, but here it is ſhewn five years after: But that was not denied by all ther other Iuſtices. Another exception was taken, that where the promiſe was, that if the Plaintiff ſhewed any Deed by which it might appear, that the Defendant ſhould be charged with the ſaid Rent, and the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, by which it might appear, that the Plaintiff ought to have the Rent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo as the Declaration doth not agree in the whole. See 1 <hi>Ma.</hi> 143. in <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſtons</hi> Caſe, the Condition of the Leaſe was, if the Rent ſhould be arrear, not paid by two Months after the Feaſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Rejoynder was by the ſpace of two months, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the pleading holden inſufficient, for <hi>per duos menſes</hi> doth not affirm directly <hi>poſt duos menſes,</hi> but by Implication and Argument: And here it was holden, that the Condition was a good conſideration. Another excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was taken, becauſe the promiſe is layed, All the Rent <hi>ad tunc debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum aut deinceps debend.</hi> It was holden, that this word <hi>(ad tunc)</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the time of the ſhewing of the Deed, and not to the promiſe. And as to the laſt exception but one, it was reſolved, that the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, notwithſtanding the ſame, was good enough <hi>(ſcil.) oſtendit factum per quod apparet quod redditus praedict. ſolvi deberet in forma praedict.</hi> Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exception was taken, becauſe here no breach of the promiſe is
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:53034:93"/>
alledged, for it is pleaded, thath eight pounds <hi>de annuali redditu arrer. fuer.</hi> but it is not ſaid, <hi>de redditu praedict.</hi> 8 <hi>l. ergo</hi> it may be another Rent, and then the promiſe, as to this Rent, is not broken. <hi>Wray,</hi> Although the word <hi>(praedict.)</hi> be wanting, yet the Declaration is well enough, and it ſhall be intended the Rent mentioned before. See 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 30. <hi>b.</hi> Where <hi>(Villa Weſt.)</hi> ſhall be intended <hi>Villa praedict.</hi> 19 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 1. In a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> the Plaintiff doth entitle himſelf by grant of the next Avoydance <hi>cum acciderit,</hi> and doth not ſhew in his Count that the ſame was the next A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydance, and yet the Count was holden to be good, for ſo it ſhall be intended; ſo here: And he ſaid, It is not neceſſary that a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be exactly certain in every point, but if one part of it expound the other, it is well enough: And although the Identity of the Rent doth not appear by the word <hi>praedict.</hi> yet it appeareth by other circumſtances, as by the days of payment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and no other Rent can be intended. And now, this Exception is after Verdict, and therefore favourably to be taken: And afterwards Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

For if a man take the ſame, and do not convert, he is not guilty. And here the Defendant doth juſtifie the converſion, wherefore he cannot plead, Not guilty. The general iſſue is to be taken where a man hath not any colour, but here the Defendant hath colour, becauſe the Corn whereof, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was growing upon his Land, which might enveigle the Lay people, and therefore it is ſafeſt to plead the ſpecial matter. But admit, that it doth amount but to the general iſſue; yet there is not any cauſe of Demurrer, but the Plaintiff ought to ſhew the ſame to the Court, and pray that the general iſſue be entred; and the Court <hi>ex officio</hi> ought to do it. <hi>Egerton,</hi> the Queens Solicitor, contrary. The Plea in Bar is not good; The Plaintiff declares of a Trover of his goods, <hi>ut de bonis ſuis propriis,</hi> and the Defendant pleads, That he took his own goods, which is not any anſwer to the Plaintiff. See 22 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 18.

Alſo the Declaration is not good in this, becauſe it is not ſhewed in what Court the ſuit did depend, ſo as it might appear unto us, that they had power to hold plea of it. <hi>Gawdy</hi> agreed with <hi>Clench</hi> in the firſt point, and alſo in the laſt; and by him, in the aſſumpſit, the Plaintiff declares, that a ſuit was depending betwixt the Defendant and another, and where the Plaintiffs if they were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced might have given ſtrong witneſs againſt the Defendant, the ſaid Defendant in conſideration that the Plaintiffs would not give Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt him, promiſed to give to the Plaintiff 20 <hi>l.</hi> the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration will not maintain this action; becauſe it is unlawful for any man to ſuppreſs teſtimony in any cauſe.<note place="margin">1 Cro. 337.</note> 
                  <hi>Wray,</hi> Here is a conſideration good enough, For where <hi>Sadler</hi> ſhould loſe coſts upon the firſt ſuit, now upon this promiſe upon his account he ſhall be allowed the ſame, the which is a benefit unto him: and as to the ſhewing in what Court the ſuit doth depend, that needs not by way of Declaration, but the ſame ſhall be ſhewed by way of Evidence, and it is not traverſable, and it is but inducement to the action.

and therefore made in perſon it is not any acknowledgment, and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch acknowledgment, <hi>Non eſt factum</hi> may be pleaded, and a Fine or confeſſion in a Writ of annuity upon preſcription, or in aſſiſe ſhall bind the houſe, See 16 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Abb.</hi> 13. That a fine, Recognizance, and Covenant of Record ſhall bind the Houſe in ſuch caſe. And the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the Prioreſs alone will ſerve in this Caſe, for the Nuns are as dead perſons: And <hi>poſito,</hi> that a Maſter of the Chancery comes into the Chapter-houſe, and receives ſuch an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I conceive that it is good enough. It hath been objected, That here the Plaintiff is not eſtopped to take the averment, becauſe we have not pleaded our matter by way of Eſtoppel; certainly the ſame needs not here, for the Record it ſelf carries the Eſtoppel with it, and the truth appeareth by the Record, and the Court ought to take hold of it. <hi>Godfrey</hi> contrary, A Deed enrolled may be avoided by matter, which is not contrary to the Record, as 19 <hi>R.</hi> 2.

And at another day it was objected, That the Deed could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged without a Letter of Attorney, being a Corporation, which conſiſted upon divers perſons, as Prioreſs and Covent, and they are alwaies to be intended to be in their Chapter-houſe, and cannot come into Court to acknowledge a Deed: To which it was anſwered by <hi>Cook,</hi> That this acknowledgment being generally pleaded, it ſhall be intended, that it was done by a Lawful means, and there is no doubt, but that ſuch a Corporation may levy a Fine, and make a Letter of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney to acknowledge it, and ſee, 2 <hi>Ma.

And an Ejectment ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the ſame day is good, and then here, this Enrolment is within the ſix Months;<note place="margin">Dyer 220. b. 1 Cro. 717.</note> and yet ſee 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 128. <hi>Dyer, Pophams</hi> caſe. It was alſo objected, That it is alledged in the conuſans, That the Manor was ſold to the Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> and that the Deed of Bargain and Sale was acknowledged and enrolled in the Chancery, the ſaid Lord being then Lord Chancelor, and he cannot take an acknowledgment of a Deed, or enrolment of it to himſelf, for he is the Sole Iudge in the ſaid Court, ſo as the Deed is acknowledged before himſelf, and enrolled before himſelf, and that is good enough, for here we are not upon the common Law, but upon the Statute, and here the words of the Statute are performed. And the enrolment of the Deed is not the ſubſtance of the Deed, but the Deed it ſelf. Alſo the acknowledgment of the Deed, after it is enrolled is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, for he is eſtopped to ſay that it is not acknowledged.

                  <hi>Owen</hi> Serjeant, It hath been agreed of both ſides, That every uſe ſhall go according to the intent of the parties, and here it appeareth, That it was the intent of the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> to put all the uſe out of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and I ſee not any difference betwixt an uſe raiſed by Covenant and a uſe raiſed by Feoffment. For a uſe limited <hi>utrovis modo</hi> to <hi>Pauls</hi> Steeple for the life of <hi>A.</hi> and after to the uſe of <hi>B.</hi> in Fee, the firſt uſe is void, but the ſecond good; and here the meaning of the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> plainly appears, for there is a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in the Indenture, That after the ſaid debts and legacies paid, the uſe limited for 24 years ſhall ceaſe, and
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53034:105"/>
it is expreſtly averred, that they are paid 11. <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>A.</hi> leaſeth for life, the remainder in tail to himſelf, the Remainder over to a ſtranger in Fee, the mean Remainder limited by <hi>A.</hi> to himſelf is void, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder over ſhall be immediate to the eſtate for life. <hi>Egerton,</hi> The words of the Indenture, and the intent of the parties are the rules of uſes, The firſt uſe is void, For the intent of the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> was void, becauſe contrary to the Law, and <hi>Euſal,</hi> to whom the uſe for years was limited, could not take preſently, for his eſtate is limited to begin after the death of the Lord <hi>Paget;</hi> and there is a great difference betwixt uſes rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Covenant, and by Feoffment, For when a uſe is raiſed by Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there all is out of the Feoffor, the land is gone, the uſe is gone, the truſt is gone, nothing remaineth but a bare authority to raiſe uſes out of the poſſeſſion of the Feoffees, &amp; being new uſes, there although ſome of them be void, yet the other ſhall ſtand; but where a uſe is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by way of Covenant there the covenantor continues in poſſeſſion, there the uſes limited, if they be according to Law, ſhall raiſe &amp; draw the poſſeſſion out of him, but if not, the poſſeſſion ſhall remain in him, until a lawful uſe ſhall ariſe, which before its time ſhall not riſe for any defect in the precedent uſe. And here is no Term, therefore no end, for that which hath not a begining hath no ending, And if there be no eſtate, then no Term, &amp; if there be ſo, then it is to be taken for the time of 24. years, which is not as yet expired, and then was there in the Lord <hi>Pawlet</hi> an eſtate deſcendable for 24 years, which by the Attainder doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue unto the Queen. And he cited the Caſe of 13 <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> 300. Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the uſe of himſelf for life, and afterwards to the uſe of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which he entendeth to marry, until the iſſue which he ſhould beget on the ſaid woman ſhould come unto the age of 21. years, and then to the uſe of the woman during her widow-hood; They are married, the Husband dieth without iſſue, the Wife ſhall hold the land: But by him, if this uſe had bin raiſed by way of Covenant it ſhould be otherwiſe. <hi>Coke</hi> Admit that all the uſes be good, yet his meaning was, That the debts and legacies being paid <hi>W. Paget</hi> ſhould have his land, for it is provided by the Indenture, That when the debts &amp; legacies are paid, the eſtate for 24. years ſhall ceaſe. <hi>Manwood,</hi> The payment of the debts cannot end that which never was, and as to the two firſt eſtates, they were never out of him, therefore they came unto the Q. by his attainder. <hi>Coke,</hi> After debts and legacies paid all other eſtates but the eſtate of <hi>W. Paget</hi> ceaſe, therefore <hi>William Paget</hi> ſhall have the Land. And the rule of <hi>Shelly</hi> 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 56 is worthy to be received, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That learning is honeſt, &amp; wiſhed to be uſed, that every man learned in the Law, do conſtrue Deeds according to the meanings of the makers. <hi>Manwood,</hi> A Feoffment to the uſe of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Plain</hi> for the life of <hi>I. S.</hi> the Remainder over, the ſame uſe ſhall come into poſſeſſion preſently, for there is not any perſon capable of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſtate, but where the firſt uſe is limited to a Baſtard, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder over, there, the Remainder ſhall not come into poſſeſſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, for the Baſtard is a perſon capable, but not by ſuch form of conveyance in conſideration of natural affection. <hi>Popham,</hi> In the caſe of Baſtard, there was an eſtate for life executed to the Father in poſſeſſion, &amp; then a Remainder to a Baſtard, the Remainder to the Sons lawfully begotten; but here in our Caſe no eſtate is created to precede the eſtate of <hi>William Paget,</hi> upon which the Remainder can depend.</p>
               <p>At another day, It was argued by <hi>Coke,</hi> It is to be agreed on both ſides, That the eſtate for four and twenty years is meerly void, and alſo the firſt uſe limited to <hi>Trentham</hi> and others, and it is not reaſon, that the uſe limited to <hi>William Paget,</hi> ſhould expect until the four and twenty years be expired by effluxion of time, and to that purpoſe he cited <hi>Cranmers</hi> Caſe, where an eſtate in uſe was limited to <hi>Cranmer</hi> for life, the Remainder to his Executors for one and twenty years, the Remainder over in tail to his Son
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53034:106"/>
and Heir, <hi>&amp;c. Cranmer</hi> is attainted of Treaſon and Hereſy, ſo as he could not make a Will, or Executors, there it is holden, That the term is void, becauſe no Executors, and that the Remainder in uſe ſhould veſt preſently, and ſhould not expect until the ſaid number of years expire by effluxion of time. And difference hath been put betwixt the caſe of <hi>Cranmer,</hi> and the Caſe at Bar, becauſe in <hi>Cranmers</hi> Caſe there was a poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility at the beginning that the Term for years might be good, for the term became void by matter <hi>ex poſt facto, ſci.</hi> By the attainder of him, which diſabled him to make Executors, but in the Caſe at Bar, the term for twenty four years was expreſly void <hi>ab initio:</hi> But that difference is without reaſon, for what reaſon is there, That the Remainder ſhould be father off the poſſeſſion when the eſtate for years is originally void, than when it becomes void by matter <hi>ex poſt facto?</hi> Suppoſe that the Lord <hi>Paget</hi> had by Indenture covenanted as above for the two firſt uſes, (being in truth void in Law) and afterwards by another Indenture, reciting, That whereas he had covenanted, That in conſideration That <hi>A.</hi> with the profits of his Lands ſhould pay his debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſtand ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of the ſaid Lands for his own life: Now he covenants, to ſtand ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the uſe of <hi>William Paget,</hi> and his Heirs, ſhould not he preſently be ſeiſed to the uſe of <hi>William Paget,</hi> and his Heirs, although the words be, That then and from thenceforth? For I hold it a clear caſe, that his eſtate begins preſently, being limited, to begin upon a void eſtate, althouh the limitation be by words <hi>de futuro.</hi> And to this purpoſe he cited the caſe 3 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Br. Leaſe</hi> 62. A man leaſeth for years, <hi>Habendum poſt dimiſſionem inde fact. to J.S. finitam,</hi> where no ſuch demiſe is made, the ſame Leaſe ſhall begin preſently: If an Indenture be made to a Monk, and another, <hi>Habend.</hi> to the Monk for one and twenty years, and after the end of that, to the other for one and twenty years, the other ſhall have it preſently. And he put a Caſe 7 <hi>E.</hi> 3. in the new Impreſſion 19. and in the old Impreſſion 317. Where one <hi>Maud</hi> brought a <hi>Formedon</hi> in the Remainder, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that one <hi>Hamond</hi> was ſeiſed, and gave the ſaid Tenements to one <hi>Robert, &amp;c.</hi> in tail, and that for want of ſuch iſſue, that the Tenements ſhould return to the ſaid <hi>Hamond</hi> for life, the Remainder to the Deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in Fee, and counted further, That <hi>Robert</hi> is dead without iſſue, and that <hi>Hamond</hi> is alſo dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was holden, although that the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſerved to the Donor, be void, yet the Remainder over in Fee is good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in that caſe although that the Remainder in Fee was fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>ſci.</hi> After the death of <hi>Hamond,</hi> &amp; the eſtate reſerved to <hi>Hamond</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly void, &amp; that originally, &amp; not by matter <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> yet the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Fee was good, and ſhould begin preſently upon the death of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> without iſſue, and ſhould not expect the death of <hi>Hamond.</hi> Mr. <hi>Attorney</hi> hath given a Rule, That the intent of the parties is the Direction of uſes, as alſo of Wills, and therefore I will put one Caſe of Wills, 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 17. If a man deviſe Lands to a Monk for four and twenty years, and after the ſame ended to another in Fee, here the Monk being a dead perſon cannot take the eſtate limited to him, &amp; therefore it is void: but the Fee limited to the other is good, and ſhall take effect preſently: If it be ſo in a Will, why not ſo alſo in uſes? For the intents of the parties do direct the conſtructions of both: And our caſe here is a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er caſe than the caſe cited 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 36. for there where Land is deviſed to a Monk for life, there may be colour of an Occupant during the life of the Monk, who might take it, although the Monk himſelf cannot take it, and ſo the Remainder doth not take effect preſently as to the poſſeſſion, but ſhall ſtay till after the death of the Monk; But here is not any colour of an Occupancy, for the eſtate here is a Leaſe for years, which cannot admit an Occupant. And ſee alſo 37 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 36. If a man deviſe that his Feoffees ſhall make an eſtate to <hi>I. S.</hi> for life, the Remainder over to <hi>C.</hi> in Fee, and <hi>I. S.</hi> will not take his eſtate, <hi>C.</hi> ſhall
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:53034:106"/>
have a <hi>Sub-poena</hi> againſt the Feoffees to make an eſtate to him, leaving out <hi>I. S.</hi> and ſee <hi>Amy Townſends</hi> Caſe in the Commentaries, where the Husband ſeiſed in the Right of his Wife, makes a Feoffment in Fee to the uſe of himſelf, and his wife for their lives, the Remainder over to another, the husband dyeth, the wife refuſeth the eſtate limited to her by the Husband, ſhe brings <hi>Sur cui in vita,</hi> not againſt the heir, but againſt him in the Remainder, to whom the Land doth accrue by the refuſal of the wife; not againſt the heir of the Feoffor; and I grant, That where an eſtate in uſe, or otherwiſe is to begin upon a condition precedent which is impoſſible, or againſt the Law, the eſtate ſhall never riſe or begin. And here the Caſe of the Lord <hi>Borroughs,</hi> 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dy.</hi> 55. was cited, Where the Father covenanted in conſideration of marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of his Son, that immediately after his death his eldeſt Son ſhall have the poſſeſſion or uſe of all his Lands according to the ſame courſe of inheritance, as then they ſtood, and that all perſons now ſeiſed, or to be ſeiſed, ſhould be ſeiſed to the ſaid uſe and intent, and it was holden, That upon that matter no uſe is changed: But if the Words had bin Immediately after his death, they ſhould remain, then although the words of the Limitation be <hi>In futuro,</hi> the uſe of the Fee ſhall reſt in the Son preſently; and the words <hi>In futuro</hi> ought not to be interpreted, but in benefit of him to whom the uſe, and eſtate is limited, 9 <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> 261. <hi>A.</hi> Leaſeth for thirty years, and four years after the beginning of the ſaid term he makes another Leaſe for years by theſe words, <hi>Nove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint, &amp;c. dictis</hi> 30 <hi>annis finitis &amp; completis, demiſiſſe omnia praemiſſa,</hi> to the ſaid, <hi>&amp;c. Habendum &amp; tenendum a die confectionis praeſentium, termino praedict finito, uſque ad finem</hi> 30 <hi>annorum.</hi> And by the opinion of all the Iuſtices, This new Leaſe ſhall commence in poſſeſſion at the end of the former term, and not before, and if it ſhould not be expounded, the ſecond Leaſe ſhould be in effect an eſtate; but for ten years, which was not the intent of the parties, and every grant ſhall be expounded moſt ſtrongly for the grantee, and to his advantage, to which purpoſe he ſaid he had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Caſe. Alſo by him there is not any difference, where the uſe is limited by way of covenant, or upon a Feoffment: And if a man enfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offeth <hi>B.</hi> upon condition that he ſhall enfeoff <hi>C.</hi> now if he offer to enfeoff <hi>C.</hi> and he refuſeth, the Feoffor may re-enter. But if the condition were to give to <hi>C.</hi> in tail, then upon ſuch refuſal of <hi>C.</hi> the Feoffor ſhall not re-enter. See 2 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 34. <hi>E. ſi Equitas ſit adhibenda</hi> in conſtruction of conditions <hi>a multo fortiori</hi> in caſe of Vſes: A Feoffment in Fee upon condition, that the Feoffee ſhall grant a Rent charge to <hi>J. S.</hi> who doth it, but <hi>J. S.</hi> refuſeth, the Feoffor ſhall not re-enter, for that was not the intent of the condition: If in the principal caſe,<note place="margin">Poſt. 266.</note> the limitation of the uſe had been after the expiration of twenty four years, then no uſe ſhould riſe before the twenty four years expire, but where, not the time, but the eſtate is material, there, if the eſtate be void, the uſe ſhall go to him in the Remainder preſently, and ſhall not ſtay the time,<note place="margin">1 Co. 154.</note>

               <p>
                  <hi>Egerton</hi> Solicitor, firſt it is to ſee, if the uſe limited to <hi>William Paget</hi> be good; ſecondly, if <hi>William Paget</hi> doth not come before his time to ſhew his Right: If this uſe limited to <hi>William Paget</hi> be a Remainder or an eſtate to begin upon a contingent, or a preſent eſtate, the eſtates formerly limited being void; and he conceived, that it is not a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for there is not any eſtate upon which it may depend; And the words are after the eſtate for twenty four years ended or expired, that then and from thenceforth to the uſe of <hi>William Paget, &amp;c.</hi> ſo that no uſe is limited to him before the particular eſtate is ended, therefore no Remainder, for a Remainder ought to begin when the particular eſtate begins. Without doubt that was not the intent that <hi>William Paget</hi> ſhould have the Land during the life of his Father, and yet the uſe limited during the life of his Father, was void, and if the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould take effect during the ſaid twenty four years againſt <hi>Euſall</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:53034:107"/>
and his companions, wherefore ſhould it not alſo take effect againſt <hi>Trentham</hi> and the others, to whoſe uſe it was limited during the life of the Lord <hi>Paget:</hi> And here, the uſe limited to <hi>William Paget</hi> is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin upon a collateral contingent, upon which if it cannot riſe, it ſhall not riſe at all; and I conceive that the uſe limited to <hi>William Paget,</hi> ſhall never riſe, or begin, for it is limited to begin when the term of twenty four years is ended, and that is never, for that which cannot begin, cannot end, and this Term is meerly void, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it cannot end, then this thenceforth cannot be, and ſo this contingent can never fall. <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp;</hi> 7. <hi>E.</hi> 6. A Leaſe was made for years upon condition, that if the Leſſee do not pay ſuch a ſum of money, that he ſhould loſe his Indenture, the meaning and ſenſe of theſe words is not that he ſhould loſe the Indenture in parchment, but that he ſhould loſe his Term: The Iudgment in an <hi>Eectjone firmae,</hi> is, <hi>Quod querens recuperet terminum ſuum,</hi> that is to be underſtood, not the time, but his Intereſt in the Land for the Term (And <hi>Coke</hi> ſecretly ſaid, that in that caſe there is not any contingent, for the eſtates precedent never began.) And as to the Caſe cited before by <hi>Coke, Br. Leaſes</hi> 62. If the laſt Leaſe be made by Indenture, reciting the former Leaſe, certainly the ſecond Leſſee ſhall not be concluded to claim the Land demiſed preſently, but ſhall tarry until the years of the firſt Term be expired by effluction of time. And as to <hi>Mawnds</hi> Caſe cited before, there is an eſtate upon which a Remainder may depend, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the eſtate tail al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to <hi>Robert, &amp;c.</hi> If ſuch as now is limited to <hi>William Paget</hi> had been limited at the Common Law to a younger Son, the eldeſt Brother ſhould have the Land in the Interim diſcharged of any uſe, and now after the Statute, no uſe limited to <hi>William Paget,</hi> before the contingent; where, therefore, is it in the mean time? In the Lord <hi>Paget,</hi> who being attainted, it accrues to the Queen; and out of the poſſeſſion of the Queen, this uſe ſhall never riſe, although that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent be performed, for now the uſe is locked up; A uſe doth conſiſt in privity of the eſtate and confidence of the perſon, if theſe be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the uſe is gone: And here, if the poſſeſſion be in the Queen, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſeiſed to another uſe. Note by <hi>Godfrey,</hi> that the opinion in <hi>Bain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Caſe, 8 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 37. is not Law, and ſo hath the Law been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of late. <hi>Popham</hi> contrary; If before the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Father covenant in conſideration of Advancement of his Son to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of <hi>I. S.</hi> for life, and after the death of <hi>I. S.</hi> to the uſe of my Son in Fee, here the eſtate of <hi>I. S.</hi> in the uſe is void, and yet the eſtate in the uſe limited to my Son, ſhall not take effect before the death of <hi>I. S.</hi> for the eſtate of my Son is not limited to take effect till after the death of <hi>I.S</hi> and therefore the poſſeſſion of the Father is not charged with the uſe during the life of <hi>I.S.</hi> But if by way of Feoffment <hi>I.S.</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, the Son ſhould have it preſently, and the Father ſhould not have it, for he by his Livery hath put all out of him, and it was not the intent of the Feoffment, that the Feoffee ſhould have the Land to his own uſe. <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pham</hi> allowed the difference mentioned before out of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 4 <hi>&amp;</hi> 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. betwixt a Feoffment upon condition to enfeoff a ſtranger, and to give in tail to a ſtranger, and that is grounded upon the intent of the parties. And <hi>Owen</hi> Serjeant put the Caſe cited before 1. 3 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 330. A Feoffment is made by the Husband to the uſe of himſelf for life, and afterwards to the uſe of one <hi>Ann,</hi> whom he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to marry, for, during, and until the Son which he ſhould beget on the body of the ſaid woman had accompliſhed the age of thirty one years, and after ſuch time that ſuch Son ſhould come unto ſuch age unto the uſe of the ſaid woman, <hi>quamdiu</hi> ſhe ſhould live ſole, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termarry, the Husband dyeth without Iſſue, the wife entreth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and continues ſole, and her Entry was adjudged lawful, and the eſtate in Remainder good, although ſhe never had any Son, and thereupon a Writ of Error was brought, and the firſt Iudgment was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:53034:107"/>
(&amp; note by <hi>Tanfield,</hi> and others at the Bar, that that was the moſt apt caſe to the purpoſe in the Law) and the reaſon of ſuch Iudgment was, becauſe they took it, that Deeds ought to be expounded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the meaning of the parties, and eſtates in poſſeſſion: I grant there ought to be a particular eſtate, upon which a Remainder may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, but the ſame is not neceſſary where the Conveyance is by way of uſe: And if I covenant that <hi>A.</hi> ſhall have my Lands to him &amp; his Heirs, to pay my Debts and Legacies, the ſame is by way of bargain and ſale, and nothing paſſeth without Enrolment. And here the Attainder doth not prevent the uſe, as it hath been objected by Maſter Solicitor, for the uſe doth riſe before the Attainder, for <hi>William Paget</hi> had a Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in tail, in the life of his Father, upon the firſt limitation, <hi>&amp;c. Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> Iuſtice, I leaſe my Lands to you, to begin after the expiration of a Leaſe which I have made thereof to <hi>I.S.</hi> and in truth he hath not any Leaſe, the ſame Leaſe ſhall never begin. <hi>Manwood</hi> chief Baron, I leaſe my Lands to you, or grant a Rent to you to begin after the death of <hi>Priſoit</hi> Serjeant at Law, when ſhall that begin? <hi>Coke,</hi> Preſently. <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, cujus contrarium eſt Lex.</hi>

And as to the other Moyety they held that the ſaid Fine was not any Bar, but that the party intereſſed at the ſame time might avoid the Fine at any time during his Nonage, &amp; five years after, for <hi>Wil.</hi> his Father was not bound by the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. becauſe at the time of the Fine levied, he was beyond the Seas, and although he never returned but died there, yet by the equity of the Statute his Iſſue ſhall have five years after his death to avoid the Fine, if he were of full age, and if he were within age, then during his Nonage, and five years after. At another day the Caſe was argued and put in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> Lands were given to Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> for life, without Impeachment of Waſt, the Remainder over to <hi>Cheny Cotton</hi> his eldeſt Son, <hi>&amp; primogenito filio &amp; haeredi Maſculo,</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Cheny, &amp; ſic de primogenito filio in primogenitum filium,</hi> the Remainder to the Heirs Males of the body of the ſaid <hi>Cheny,</hi> &amp; for want of ſuch Iſſue, the Remainder to <hi>Wil.

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:53034:113"/>
a good Tail; and ſo he conceived in this Caſe, that although the words of the Limitation are not apt to create an Eſtate-tail accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the phraſe and ſtile of the ſaid Statute of <hi>VVeſt</hi> 2. yet here the intent of the Donor appears to continue the Land in his Name and Blood, for <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Son could not take with his Father by his Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for he was not in <hi>rerum natura,</hi> and therefore all ſhall veſt in <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> the Father, which ſee 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3 <hi>Fitz.

Now it is to ſee, if upon the Limitation to Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> and <hi>VVilliam</hi> his Son, by which the Remainder is limited to Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> and <hi>VVilliam,</hi> and the Heirs Males of their bodies iſſuing, the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> &amp; <hi>Wil.</hi> have a joynt Eſtate-tail; in reſpect that the Iſſue of the body of the Son, may be Heir of the Body of the Father: and ſo becauſe they might have one Heir which ſhall be inheritable to his Land, it ſhall be one entire Eſtate-tail in them: But he conceived that they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Eſtates-tail, and that they are Tenants in Common of an Eſtate tail, 3 <hi>&amp;</hi> 4 <hi>Phil. &amp; Mar.

Land given to the Father and Son, and to the Heirs of their two Bodies begotten, the Remainder over in Fee, the Father dieth without other Iſſue than the Son only, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the Son dieth withou Iſſue, a ſtranger abates: Or if the Son hath made a Diſcontinuance, if he in the Remainder ſhall have but one or two ſeveral <hi>Formedons</hi> was the Queſtion. And by <hi>Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Brook,</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> but one <hi>Formedon,</hi> and <hi>Quaere</hi> left of it; yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that, yet notwithſtanding that, it might be that they had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Eſtates-tail, 17 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 51. 78. Land given to a man and his Siſter, and to the Heirs of their two Bodies iſſuing, they have ſeveral Eſtates tail, and yet one <hi>Formedon.</hi> And ſee 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 85. Land given to a man and his Mother, or to her Daughter in Tail, here are ſeveral Entails And here in the principal Caſe, Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> hath one Moyety in Tail expectant upon his Eſtate for life: and therefore as to the Moyety of Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> he is bound by the Fine. And the other Moyety is left in the Son, who may enter for a Forfeiture upon the alienation made by his Father, as well in the life of the Father, as afterwards. Now after this Fine levied, the entry of <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Son by virtue of his Remainder is lawful after the death of Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> although that <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Father was beyond the Sea at the time of the Fine levied, and there afterwards died, <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Son being within age. The words of the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. are, Other than Women Covert, or out of this Realm, &amp;c. ſo that they or their Heirs make their Entry, &amp;c. within five years after they return into this Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that by the bare letter of the Act, <hi>VVill.</hi> the Son hath not remedy, nor relief by this Act againſt the Fine, becauſe that <hi>William,</hi> the Father died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea, without any return into <hi>England;</hi> yet by the Equity of the Statute he ſhall have five years to make his Claim, although his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never return, for if ſuch literal conſtruction ſhould be allowed, it ſhould be a great miſchief, and it ſhould be a hard Expoſition, for this Statute ought to be taken by Equity, as it appeareth by diverſe Caſes, 19 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 6. My Vncle doth diſſeiſe my Father, and afterwards levies a Fine with Proclamations; my Father dieth, and after within five years my Vncle dies, that Fine is no Bar to me, yet the Exception doth not help me, for I am Heir to him that levied the Fine, and ſo privy to it, but my Title to the Land, is not as Heir to my Vncle but to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So if an Infant after ſuch a Fine levied, dieth before his full age, his Heir may enter within five years after, and yet that Caſe is out of the Letter of the Statute. And by <hi>Brown</hi> and <hi>Sanders,</hi> If the Diſſeiſee dieth, his Wife <hi>enſeint</hi> with a Son, the Diſſeiſor levieth a Fine, the Son is born, although this Son is not excepted expreſſly by the words, becauſe not in <hi>rerum natura</hi> at the time of the Fine levied, &amp;c. yet ſuch an Infant is within the equity and meaning of the ſaid Statute. See the Caſe betwixt <hi>Stowel</hi> and <hi>Zouch, Plow. Com.</hi> 366. And by him,
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:53034:114"/>
It was holden, 6. <hi>Eliz.</hi> that an Infant brought a <hi>Formdon</hi> within age, and adjudged maintainable, although the words of the Statute be, That they ſhall take their Actions or lawful Entries within five years after they come of full age: And he alſo argued, that here, when Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> being Tenant for life, levyed a Fine, which is a Forfeiture, he in the Remainder is to have five years after the Fine levyed, in reſpect of the preſent forfeiture, and alſo five years after the death of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life: And that was the caſe of one <hi>Some</hi> adjudged accordingly in the Common Pleas: It hath been objected on the other ſide, That the Defendant entring by color of the Leaſe at Will made to him by <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> who was an Infant, that he was a Diſſeiſor as well to the Infant as to the Leſſor of the Plaintiff, who had the Moyety as Tenant in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with the Infant, and then when the Leſſor of the Plaintiff entred upon the Defendant, and leaſed to the Plaintiff, and the Defendant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entred and ejected the Plaintiff, he is a Diſſeiſor; to which he anſwered, That the Defendant when he entred by the Leaſe at Will, he was no Diſſeiſor, for ſuch a Leaſe of an Infant is not void, but only voidable, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then a ſufficient Leaſe againſt the Plaintiff, although not againſt the Infant. <hi>Beaumont</hi> Serjeant, to the contrary; By this manner of gift, <hi>William</hi> the Son took nothing, but the eſtate ſetled only in <hi>William</hi> the Father, but not an eſtate tail, by the words, <hi>haeredi maſculo, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas Donatoris,</hi> without ſufficient words cannot create an eſtate tail; but where the intent of the Donor is not according to the Law, the Law ſhall not be conſtrued according to his intent: But this intent ſhall be taken according to the Law. And he held that Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>VVilliam</hi> had ſeveral eſtates in tail, and ſeveral Moyeties, and not one entire eſtate, and here, upon all the matter, Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> is Tenant for life of the whole, the Remainder of one moyety to him in tail, the Remainder of the other moyety unto <hi>VVilliam</hi> in tail, and, <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi> Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> levying a Fine of the whole, now as to one moyety which the Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor had in tail, the Fine is clearly good, and ſo as to that, <hi>Robert</hi> the Leſſor of the Plaintiff had a good Title, as to the ſaid moyety; and as to the other moyety he conceived alſo, that <hi>VVilliam</hi> is bound, for this Statute ſhall not be conſtrued by Equity, but ſhall bind all who are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly excepted, and that is not <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Son, for his Father never returned, and then his Heir is not releived by the Statute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Alſo <hi>VVilliam</hi> had a Right of Entry at the time of the Fine levyed, <hi>ſcil.</hi> for the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture, and becauſe he hath ſurceaſed the time, for the ſaid Right of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he ſhall not have now five years after the death of Tenant for life, for he is the ſame perſon, and the ſecond ſaving which provides forfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rights, extends to other perſons than thoſe who are intended in the firſt ſaving, and he who may take advantage of the firſt ſaving, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be releived by the ſecond ſaving, for no new title doth accrue to him in the Reverſion or Remainder, by the death of Tenant for life, for that title accrued to him by the forfeiture, ſo as the title which he hath by the death of the Tenant for life, is not the title which firſt accrued unto him: Alſo by this Forfeiture, the eſtate for life is determined, as if Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant for life had been dead; for if Tenant for life maketh a Feoffment in Fee, the Leſſor may have a Writ of Entry <hi>ad terminum qui praeterijt. Fitz.</hi> 201. which proves, that by the Forfeiture the eſtate is determined, and then no new title doth accrue to him in the Remainder, by the death of the Tenant for life, but that only which he had before the alienation, ſo that his non-claim after the five years ſhall bind him. Then, when <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Infant having a Right to a moyety, and <hi>Robert</hi> the Leſſor of the Plaintiff a Right to the other moyety, and the Infant leaſeth unto the Defendant at Will, who entreth, now is he a Diſſeiſor as well to <hi>Robert</hi> as to the Infant: Then if the Defendant be Diſſeiſor and hath no title by the Infant, <hi>Robert</hi> who hath Right in a moyety may well enter into the whole, for he hath the poſſeſſion <hi>per my &amp; per
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:53034:114"/>
tout</hi> by his Entry, and then when the Defendant doth eject him, he hath good cauſe of Action. And after at another day the Caſe was moved, and it was agreed, That for one moyety the Infant is bound, for Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> had an eſtate tail in a moyety, for he was Iſſue of the body of the Comiſor: But for the other moyety, the Fine levyed by Tenant for life, <hi>William</hi> the Father being then Tenant beyond the Sea, It was holden by <hi>Anderſon, Windham,</hi> and <hi>Walmeſly,</hi> that the Infant was not barred, notwithſtanding the objection aboveſaid, That <hi>William</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther never returned into <hi>England,</hi> and notwithſtanding the words of the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. And by <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> If an infant make his claim with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in age it is ſufficient to avoid the Fine, and yet the ſaid Statute ſeems to appoint to him time within five years after his full age, ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the very words, a claim made before or after ſhould be vain, yet in Equity, although he be not compelſable to make his claim until the time allowed by the Statute, yet if he make it before, it is good enough. And by <hi>Anderſon,</hi> Although that <hi>VVilliam</hi> the Father did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, yet if he makes not his claim within five years after the death of his Father being of full age, and without any impediment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ſhall be barred. If in ſuch caſe a man hath many impediments, he is not compellable to make his claim when one of the impediments is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but when they are all removed. So if the Anceſtor hath one of the ſaid impediments, and dieth before it be removed, and his Heir is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in age, or hath other impediment, he is not bound to make is claim till five years after his impediment is removed. And <hi>Somes</hi> caſe cited before was holden and agreed to be good Law, for the Forfeiture may not be known unto him. And as to the objection againſt the Leaſe at Will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was made by an Infant, and no Rent reſerved upon it, nor the Leaſe made upon the Land, and therefore the Leſſee ſhould be a Diſſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, To that it was anſwered, Be the Defendant a Diſſeiſor, or not, it is not material here, for if the Plaintiff had not title according to his Declaration, he cannot recover,<note place="margin">1 Cro. 220. 1 Cro. 438.</note> whether the Defendant hath title or not, for it is not like unto Treſpaſs where the very poſſeſſion without other title is good, contrary in Actions againſt all who gave not title; but in <hi>Ejectione firmae,</hi> if the title of the Plaintiff be not good and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, be the title of the Defendant good or not, he ſhall not recover: And afterwards Iudgment was given for the Defendant, <hi>Hill.</hi> 33. <hi>Eliz.</hi>

for by <hi>Anderſon,</hi> and <hi>Periam,</hi> until election be made he ſhall not be ſaid to have it as Legatee, eſpecially if it be not alledged in fact, that all the debts of the Teſtator are paid: And <hi>Anderſon</hi> doubted, although that it be alledged, that the debts be paid, If the Executor ſhall be ſaid to have the ſaid Leaſe as a Legacy, before ſhe hath made Election, <hi>vid.

               <p>THe Caſe between the Lord <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Brown,</hi> was, that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Grace</hi> was ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Graveſend</hi> in the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> which Mannor doth extend to the Pariſhes of <hi>Graveſend,</hi> and <hi>Milton,</hi> and that the ſaid Abbot and all his Predeceſſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> time out of mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have had a Water-Court within the ſaid Mannor, which Court had been holden at <hi>Graveſend</hi> Bridge in the end of it, and that all the Inhabitants within the ſaid Pariſhes, which have Boats ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther entirely or joyntly with others, and have uſed to tranſport or car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry paſſengers from <hi>Graveſend</hi> to <hi>London, &amp; e contra,</hi> and have uſed to faſten their Boats at the ſaid Bridge of <hi>Graveſend,</hi> have uſed to do ſuit at the ſaid Court, and there have uſed to enquire of all miſ-orders, and miſ-demeanors of Water-men there, and that the ſaid Abbots, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have uſed to have the Fines and Amercements of the ſame Court, and conveyed the ſaid Mannor to the Plaintiff, and that at a Court there holden, The Defendant being ſworn with the reſidue of the Enqueſt to enquire of ſuch diſ-orders, refuſed to give his Verdict, for which for the ſaid contempt, the Defendant, by the then Steward was amerced twenty ſhillings, for the which Amercement the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff brought an Action of Debt: It was moved by <hi>Beaumount</hi> Serjeant; That the Action did not lye, for the Preſcription upon which the Action is grounded is not good; firſt, he claims to have this Court within his Mannor, and as a thing appertaining to it, and yet he claims ſuit at his Court of all the Inhabitants of the ſaid two Pariſhes, &amp; to have them Suitors at it, being meer ſtrangers to the Mannor, &amp; which do not hold of it, for although it be alledged, that the ſaid Mannor doth extend
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:53034:115"/>
in the ſaid Pariſhes, yet the ſame doth not prove that every part of the ſaid Pariſhes is within the ſaid Manor, and if it be not ſo, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription may extend as well to all the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> as well as to the ſaid two Pariſhes, for ſuch a Preſcription cannot bind but thoſe which are Tenants of the ſaid Manor, and cannot extend to ſtrangers, which ſee 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 40. The Caſe of Pound-breach. Secondly, it is not alleadged here, that the Steward ought and had uſed to aſſeſs Amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for by the common Law no Steward hath authority to aſſeſs Amercements or Fines in a Court Baron, for there the Suitors are Iudges &amp; not the Steward; &amp; that this Water-Court is a Court Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, it appeareth by the Declaration, for there it is ſaid that it is a Court belonging to ſuch a Manor, and that <hi>prima facie</hi> ſhall be meant a Court Baron, if the contrary be not ſhewed, <hi>vi. Fitz.</hi> 75. <hi>g.</hi> Thirdly it is not ſhewed that the Amercement was affered, which ſee <hi>ib.</hi> 75. <hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant, to the contrary: This Court upon the whole matter is in nature of a Leet for the reformation of miſ-orders between the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen, and the preſcription here will warrant ſuch a Court well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, And there are many Courts in <hi>England</hi> which are not Court Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons, but grounded upon Preſcription, 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 17. The Court before the Chancellor of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Preſcription to have <hi>Swan mote,</hi> and it is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that this Preſcription ſhould hold place, for here is <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> for Watermen receive their carriage and loading at this Bridge, and alſo diſcharge their loading there, and they uſe to faſten their Boats there, and therefore in lieu of that benefit, it is reaſon that they be attendant at the Court which is upon the ſaid Bridge, and upon that reaſon is the Preſcription of Toll Traverſe, 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 9. And to have a Land Bird, 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 15. And Toll of every Veſſel which paſſeth the River, 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 16. And this Court may be a Court within the Manor, and yet no Court Baron, but in the nature of a Leet, and the Preſcription ſhall be good in Law by reaſon of the recompence to the Suitors, and then, if it be not a Court Baron, but rather in the nature of a Leet, then it follows, that the Suitors are not Iudges but the Steward; and it behoves not to preſcribe for the Amercement, for that is incident to a Court Leet, for otherwiſe how can the Suitors be compelled to do their ſuit at it, or their defaults, or contempts at the ſame be puniſhed? and as to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the Amercement, it needs not here, for it is a Fine for the open contempt, and deſpite done unto the Court, and not an Amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and it may well be aſſeſſed by the Steward alone, <hi>vi.</hi> 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Br. Leet,</hi> 37. <hi>Drill</hi> Serjeant, to the contrary: For this Preſcription is not reaſonable, to drive ſtrangers to do ſuit at a Court Baron, for there is ſufficient conſideration in the Caſe of Tenants of the Manor; for it may be at the beginning, the Tenancies were given upon ſuch conſideration to do ſuch ſuit: But in the principal caſe, the Preſcription is their ground, and therefore unreaſonable, becauſe without conſideration, 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 43. ſee the caſe there, and 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 20. A cuſtom alleadged, that if any Tenant diſtrain the Beaſts of another Damage Feaſant, That he ought to bring ſuch Beaſts to the pound of the Lord of the Manor; and if not, That at the next Court he ſhould be amerced twelve pence, and the ſame was holden no good cuſtom, becauſe againſt common Right and common Law. <hi>Puckering</hi> Serjeant: If this Court ſhall be reputed in Law a Court Baron, then the Preſcription, for the maner of it is not good, for in ſuch caſe, the Amercement cannot be aſſeſſed by the Steward; But he held, that this Court is in the nature of a Court Leet, and not a Court Baron, and all Inhabitants within the Precinct of it, are bounden to do their ſuit at it by reaſon of their Reſiancy, &amp; their trade there, if they have Boats, or ſhares in Boats, and ſuch Court is for the better government of ſuch Watermen, and the exerciſe and practiſe of their trade, and for the redreſſing of miſdemeanors be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, and ſo this Court hath a reaſonable commencement, being
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:53034:116"/>
inſtituted for the publick good, and if cuſtoms which concern the private benefit of any be allowable; as the Mayor and Burgeſſes of a Town preſcribe to have of every Tun which cometh in any Ship into their Port, and put upon the Land 6.<hi>d.</hi> for Toll. See 21 <hi>H.</hi> 16. <hi>A fortiori,</hi> a Cuſtom or Preſcription which concerns the publick good, is good: &amp; it is not ſtrange that ſuch Court hath been maintained by Preſcription, for the Court of <hi>Stanneris</hi> is ſo without any commencement or erection, but by Cuſtom. And although that Toll cannot be paid at any Market for things brought to Market, but for things ſold, yet by cuſtom Toll ſhall be paid for every thing brought to Market, and for the ſtanding of the Seller there; for the ſale of Victuals is for the good of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, which thing is the ground of the Preſcription in the principal Caſe, &amp; therefore the Preſcription in the manner of it is good: and if the preſcription be good for the Court, then to have a Steward to keep the Court, to aſſeſs Fines for contempts and diſorders is good without any ſpecial preſcription, for it is incident to it. <hi>Periam</hi> Iuſtice, If it be a Court-baron then cannot the Steward impoſe or aſſeſs any Fine: which <hi>Windham</hi> granted; but he ſaid it is not a Court-baron, but a Court by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription. <hi>Periam,</hi> If the Plaintiff claim it as belonging to his Manor, it ſhall be intended a Court-baron, but yet a man may have a Court within his Manor by preſcription, which is not a Court-baron. <hi>Anderſon</hi> was of opinion that it is not a Court-baron, for although it be apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the Manor, yet that is not any proof that it is a Court-baron: For a Leet may be appertaining to a Manor.

               <p>IN Debt upon Surpluſage of an Accompt by <hi>Gawton,</hi> againſt <hi>George</hi> Lord <hi>Dacres;</hi> It was ſaid by <hi>Periam</hi> Iuſtice, and not denied by any, that if I make <hi>J. S.</hi> my Auditor, generally to take Accompts of all my Bayliffs and Receivors, that he is not a ſufficient Auditor without a Patent; for when a man is made an Auditor generally, he is an Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, and an Officer cannot be without a Deed. But if a Bayliff, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver be accomptable to me, it is as cleer on the other ſide, that I may appoint one to be my Auditor to take the accompt of him, <hi>pro hac vice</hi> by word; which <hi>Anderſon</hi> granted: But if he afterwards takes an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt of any by force or colour of the ſaid Warrant without my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, he is not a ſufficient Auditor to ſuch intent, either to take the accompt, or to aſſeſs the arrerages if the accomptant be found in arrear, or to make allowance if he be found in Surpluſage: And by him. If one become my Bayliff of his own wrong, without my appointment, he is accomptable to me, but I am not compellable to make him any allowance for his Expences about my buſineſs. And if I aſſign to ſuch Bayliff of his own wrong an Auditor, he cannot make allowance of ſuch Expences. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> If my Auditor make allowance to my Bayliff for any collateral Expences, which he hath expended in my affairs, which do not concern my Manor, whereof he is Bayliff, ſuch allowance ſhall not bind me. And note, that in this Action the Plaintiff declared that he was Bayliff to the Defendant of certain Manors, Receiver of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain monies, and ſo retained, <hi>ad diverſa negotia procurandum:</hi> And upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt the allowance was made unto him for his Board-wages, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Expences in riding <hi>Circa negotia.</hi> And by <hi>Anderſon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Len. 149.</note> theſe allowances ſhall not bind the Defendant; for as Bayliff of a Manor, no Expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhall be allowed unto him, but thoſe which the Bayliff hath expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Manor: And if I retain one to go about my buſineſs he is not accomptable. <hi>Windham,</hi> If I retain one to follow my buſineſs, and deliver to him mony to disburſe in ſuch buſineſs, he is accomptable. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> It is ſo truly, but it is not in reſpect of the ſaid Retainer,<note place="margin">Deviſes.</note> but as he was Receiver, and if he expend more than he hath received, he doth it without Warrant and no allowance ſhall be made unto him.

And further, that the Plaintiff ſhall have free ingreſs and regreſs to a Chamber in the houſe of the Defendant in the mean time. And upon <hi>Non-aſſumpſit</hi> pleaded, it was found by the Iury, that ſuch a Recovery was in the ſaid Court, and that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant did aſſume, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they further ſay, that before the ſaid Recovery, the ſaid <hi>Thomas Ward</hi> was poſſeſſed of the ſaid Goods as of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per goods: And, by Deed indented, ſold them to his Brother <hi>R. W.</hi> in conſideration of a certain ſum of mony, with a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Tho. Ward,</hi> notwithſtanding the ſaid ſale ſhould have the poſſeſſion of them for four years, which are not yet expired, paying to the ſaid <hi>R.

Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was taken to the Declaration, becauſe it was not ſhewed by what Authority or Title the Court was holden; Alſo it ſheweth, that the Bayliff was ready to do Execution upon the ſaid Goods, but doth

not ſhew where the ſaid goods then were, but the exceptions were not allowed, for theſe matters are but inducement and conveyance to the action, and not the matter, or ſubſtance of it. Another exception was taken, becauſe the requeſt is not ſufficiently alleadged, <hi>Licet ſaepius requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitus,</hi> but that exception was not allowed, for here the Aſſumpſit is to pay at a certain day, and then the requeſt is not material; but where a Requeſt is parcel of the Aſſumpſit,<note place="margin">Requeſt.</note> there an expreſs Requeſt ought to be taxed, as if the payment ſhould be upon Requeſt. As to the matter in Law, here is not any conſideration, for the goods were not ſubject to execution, for <hi>Thomas Ward</hi> had but a ſpecial property in them, but the general property was in <hi>R.

VVard</hi> had the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral property, yet <hi>Thomas</hi> had the ſpecial and preſent property, and that againſt <hi>R. VVard</hi> himſelf, ſo that during the ſaid four years <hi>R. VVard</hi> could not entermeddle with the goods; and though that no execution can be had againſt him who hath ſuch a ſpecial property, yet that is not the caſe here, for here one who hath the poſſeſſion of certain goods, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers them to another, and in conſideration thereof, he to whom the delivery is made, promiſeth to re-deliver them unto the Bailee, or to pay ſo much mony, this is a good conſideration, when a lawful property or title he hath who makes the Delivery. And of that opinion were all the Iuſtices, for it appeareth, that the Plaintiff had a poſſeſſion of the ſaid goods, and that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Ward</hi> had a ſpecial property, and becauſe of ſuch poſſeſſion was chargeable to an action of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Ward,</hi> be it that the Plaintiff comes to the ſaid goods by baylment or Trover, for by <hi>Periam,</hi> if goods come to another by Trover, and he delivereth them over, he is anſwerable to him who hath right unto them: The Delivery of theſe goods to the Defendant, is a good conſideration, and the Defendant hath benefit by the uſe of them, and the property of the goods is not to be argued in this caſe, but the Delivery to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant is the only matter: And becauſe the Delivery of the goods to the Defendant, and the Aſſumpſit upon it, it was holden, although the goods were not liable to execution, yet the Aſſumpſit was good, and afterwards Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

The Plaintiff declared that he was poſſeſſed of certain goods as of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per goods and loſt them, and the Defendant found them and converted them to his own uſe; the Defendant pleaded, that the Plaintiff pawned the ſaid goods to the Defendant for ten pounds, for which he detained them according to the ſaid pawn, and traverſed the converſion; and by ſome it was holden, that he ought to plead not guilty, &amp; give the eſpecial matter aforeſaid in Evidence; and 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Ma. Dyer</hi> 121. The caſe of the Lord <hi>Mountegle,</hi> in an action upon the Caſe, the Plaintiff declared upon a Trover of a Chain of Gold, and that the Defendant had ſold it to perſons unknown, the Defendant pleaded, That <hi>ipſe non vendidit modo &amp; forma,</hi> &amp; upon that the Plaintiff did demur in Law. And ſee 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. Where goods come to one by Trover, he ſhall not be charged in an action, but for the time he hath the poſſeſſion; But that is to be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an Action of Detinue, and not in an action upon the Caſe, for ſuch action upon the Caſe is not grounded upon the Trover, but upon the miſ-demeanor, that is, the Converſion. And as to the other Plea it is utterly inſufficient, for the Plaintiff declares of a Converſion, and he pleads a poſſeſſion, that he is always ready, and ſo doth not anſwer to the point of the action. <hi>Yelverton</hi> Serjeant, to the contrary, and he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived for the firſt Plea, that it is a direct anſwer, for he hath juſtified his ſale to perſons unknown, for that he hath bought the goods of one <hi>Copland</hi> whoſe goods they were, and becauſe the Plaintiff hath demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the Plea, he hath confeſſed the truth of the matter contained in it, <hi>ſcil.</hi> that the property of the goods was to <hi>Copland,</hi> and ſo in Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant by the ſaid ſale, and then he hath good cauſe to convert them to his own uſe by ſale or otherwiſe; And he conceived, that there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. betwixt Baylment, and Trover, for in caſe of Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the parry is not chargeable but in reſpect of the poſſeſſion, which being removed, the action is gone againſt the Finder, for he who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth goods is not bound to keep them, nor to give an account for them. And he put the caſe reported by <hi>Dyer,</hi> 13 <hi>&amp;</hi> 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 306, 307. <hi>R. Fines</hi> brought an action upon the caſe, and declared, he was poſſeſſed of a Hawk, as of his proper goods at <hi>W.</hi> and caſually loſt it at <hi>B.</hi> and that it afterwards caſually came to the hands of the Defendant by Trover, and that he knowing it to be the Plaintiffs Hawk, ſold the ſame for mony to perſons unknown; The Defendant pleaded that the Hawk firſt after the loſing of it came to the hands of one <hi>Jeoffryes,</hi> who ſold it to one <hi>Rowly,</hi> who gave it to the Defendant at <hi>A.</hi> who ſold it to <hi>Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the ſame was found a ſufficient Bar; and it is hard where goods, as Oxen or Horſes come to another by Trover, that he ſhould be charged to keep them and paſture them until the Owner claimeth them, and therefore it is not reaſon but that he diſcharge himſelf by the quitting of the poſſeſſion of them. And as to the other Plea, the matter of the Plea is good enough, and the defect is but in the form, which becauſe the Plaintiff upon his Demurrer hath not ſhewed to the Court according to the Statute, he ſhall not take advantage of it, but the matter of the Plea is ſufficient, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the finding, and the offer to deliver it to the Plaintiff. <hi>Anderſon</hi> Iuſtice, For the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the inſufficiency of this Plea, the nature of the action, and
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:53034:118"/>
the cauſe of it is to be conſidered; the nature of the action, it is an action upon the caſe, the cauſe, the Trover, and converſion; Then for the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Plea his readineſs, to deliver it, It cannot be any anſwer to the Declaration of the Plaintiff: For this action is not Debt or Detinue, where the thing it ſelf is to be delivered, for in ſuch caſe, the Plea had been good, but the Converſion is the ſpecial cauſe of this Action, which by this is not anſwered, and for the other Plea, the Declaration is not anſwered by it. But here is ſome matter of juſtification, for when a man comes to goods by Trover, there is not any doubt but by the Law he hath liberty to take the poſſeſſion of them, but he cannot abuſe them, kill them, or convert them to his own uſe, or make any profit of them, and if he do, it is great reaſon that he be anſwerable for the ſame, but if he loſe ſuch goods afterwards, or they be taken from him, then he ſhall not be charged, for he is not bound to keep them, and ſo he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Iudgment ought to be for the Plaintiff. <hi>Windham</hi> Iuſtice, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plea is good; as to the firſt Plea, he confeſſeth the converſion, but hath not conveyed unto himſelf a ſufficient title to the goods by which he might juſtifie the Converſion, for the Plaintiff declares of a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his own goods, and the Defendant juſtifies, becauſe the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the goods was in a ſtranger who ſold them to him, which cannot be any good title for him without a Traverſe, unleſs he had ſhewed, that he bought them in an open Market, and then upon ſuch matter he might well have juſtified the Converſion. And as to the other Plea, the ſame is naught alſo, for the goods are not in demand, and their the ſaid Plea is not proper to ſay, that he is ready to deliver them, for damages only for the converſion are in demand, and not the goods themſelves, and therefore the ſame is a Plea but by Argument, <hi>ſcil.</hi> He is ready to deliver, <hi>Ergo,</hi> he hath not converted, and yet the ſame is not a good argument, for if a man find my Horſe, and rides upon him, or hereby he becomes Lame, or otherwiſe by exceſſive travel miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeth him, ſo as my Horſe is the worſe thereby; He may be ready to deliver me my Horſe, and yet this action will ly, for ſuch an abuſing of the Horſe is a Converſion to his own uſe. <hi>Periam</hi> Iuſtice,<note place="margin">Poſt. 224.</note> The latter Plea clearly is inſufficient, for it amounteth but to Not guilty, but for the firſt Plea, he doubted of it, for firſt the property is not traverſable, nor the knowing; but upon the general Iſſue pleaded, ſuch matter may be given in Evidence. And he conceived, That where a man buyes goods of one who comes to them by Trover, that he may ſell them, and ſhall not be anſwerable for them. And although it may be ſaid, that the ſaid matter may be given in evidence, yet it is not good to put the ſame to the people, but to refer the matter to the Iudgment of the Court. <hi>Walm.</hi> Iuſtice, The latter Plea is clearly inſufficient, but for the firſt he doubted of it, for he conceived that the ſale of the goods is not a Converſion. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> The firſt Plea is, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> and nothing in that is material or traverſable, for all the Plea may be true, and yet the Defendant is guilty, for it may be that the Defendant himſelf ſold them to the Plaintiff, or to another who ſold them to the Plaintiff, and that afterwards the Defendant found them, and here the Converſion is confeſſed, and not ſo voided by ſufficient juſtification, and by him, the ſale to perſons unknown is no good Plea, for his ſale is his own Act, and it cannot be but he muſt have notice of the buyers, and therefore he ought in his Plea to ſhew their names. <hi>Periam,</hi> Contrary to that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as to the naming of the buyers, for it ſhould be an infinite thing for a Draper to take notice of every on who buyeth and Ell of Cloath of him. And afterwards the ſame Term Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff upon the inſufficiency of the Plea.</p>

And the Iury found a ſpecial Verdict, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That the ſaid <hi>Forcet circa</hi> 9 <hi>Aprilis,</hi> 7 <hi>E.</hi> 6. was retained by one <hi>Elizabeth Pagnam,</hi> then, before and afterwards Lady of the ſaid Manor, to be her Steward there for the keeping of the Courts of the ſaid Manor; and this Retainer was only by Word in the Countrey, and no Fee or Annuity given for the exerciſe of the ſaid Office: and that the ſaid <hi>Forcet,</hi> according to the ſaid Retainer, had kept Courts there divers times. And further, that ſuch a day and year at St. <hi>Dunſtans</hi> in the Eaſt, the ſaid <hi>Forcet</hi> took a Surrender, which was entred in the Rolls the next Court: and that before that and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he took divers Surrenders as well out of Court, as in Court, and had holden divers Courts there. And upon this Verdict, it was moved by <hi>Snagg</hi> Serjeant, That <hi>Forcet</hi> upon the matter found by the Verdict is not ſuch a Steward, that may take Surrenders out of Court, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retained only by word, although to do other Acts in Court he be a ſufficient Steward, for in the Court he is as a Iudge, and no body is to diſpute his Authority there. And there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Steward of a Manor, and a Steward of Courts; and a Steward of one Manor hath not as great an authority as the Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of another Manor, for a Steward of a Manor may take Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in any place, otherwiſe it is where a Steward is retained to keep

Here <hi>Forcet</hi> upon this Retainder was Steward at the Will of the Lady of the Manor, which Will ſhall not be ſaid to be determined, until the Lady doth diſcharge him: and the difference which hath been taken betwixt Steward of Courts, and a Steward of a Manor is nothing to the purpoſe, for there is not any reaſon in it: and it is true, an Aſſiſe cannot be brought of ſuch an Office, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Patent of it, for it cannot paſs for life without a Deed; and although a Steward in the Courts of Copyholders be a Iudge, yet he may be appointed without Deed: as where two ſubmit themſelves to the arbitration of others, now the Arbitrators are Iudges as to that intent, and yet they may be appointed Arbitrators, and diſcharged without Deed, 19 <hi>H</hi> 6. 6. 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 3. 21 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 30. but they cannot by their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward transfer Free-hold from one to another, 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 26. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 18. and 17. by <hi>Culpeper</hi> and <hi>Skreen;</hi> and ſee as to a Steward retained by word, 8 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 248. and ſee 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 25, 26, 27. where a Bayliff of a Manor may be appointed without Deed, and ſo of an under-Sheriff, and yet he is a Iudge. <hi>Owen</hi> Serjant contrary, Here <hi>Forcet</hi> at the time of this Surrender was not Steward, but the Retainer void. 1. No Fee is allowed unto him for the exerciſe of the ſaid Office, 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. A Labourer may be retained without promiſe of any Sallary in certain, for it is appointed by the Law. 2. He is not retained by Deed, and although he may be retained without Deed to hold Court, <hi>pro hac vice,</hi> yet if the Retainer be for life, or for years, it ought to be by Deed. 3. He was retained to keep the Court, but not to be Steward, which ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hold Court, and then when that is paſt his authority ſhall ceaſe, and then all which he doth afterwards is void. But if he had been retained to be Steward of the Manor, then the Surrender taken out of Court had been well enough. 4. There is not any cuſtom found by the Verdict, to warrant ſuch a Surrender taken out of Court, and then if the Surrender be not warranted by their cuſtom it is void. <hi>Yelverton</hi> to the contrary, In all caſes in real actions which concern Lands, the Suitors are the Iudges; but in perſonal actions under the ſum of forty ſhillings the Steward is Iudge: and although he be a Iudge, yet he may be appointed without Deed. And whereas it hath been objected, that no Fee is appointed for the exerciſing of the Office, the ſame is not material as to the Grant, but the party is not compellable without a Fee to do the ſervice: and a man may be conſtituted Bayliff of ſuch a Manor without Deed, and yet more doth appertain to the Office of the Bayliff, than to the Steward: as if the Lord of a Manor be beyond the Sea,<note n="*" place="margin">More 1 Rep.</note> the Writ of Right ſhall be directed to the Bayliff of the Manor: and ſee 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 36, 37.

                  <hi>GUilford</hi> was Indicted upon the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing divers perſons, her Majeſties Subjects, from the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſtabliſhed in <hi>England</hi> to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and to promiſe obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and for that he himſelf was with-drawn from the obedience of the Queen. <hi>Coke</hi> took Exception to the Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe that the Indictment was not found within the year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the offence committed. In the ſaid Act there is a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That all offences againſt the Act, ſhall and may be enquired of within the year and day after the offence committed. <hi>Popham</hi> Attorney General, This caſe is not within that <hi>Proviſo,</hi> but doth depend upon other Statutes before, <hi>viz.</hi> 1, 5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> touching the acknowledging of her Majeſties ſupream Government in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, or other matters touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſervice of God, or coming to Church, or eſtabliſhing of true Religion within this Realm, ſhall and may be enquired as well before the Iuſtices of the Peace, as other Iuſtices named in the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:53034:126"/>
within one year and a day after ſuch offence committed: And he ſaid, theſe words in the <hi>Proviſo</hi> refer only to ſuch offences contained in the ſaid Act, which toucheth the Supremacy and cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, &amp;c. and ſuch offences ought to be enquired within the year and day: But this Indictment here doth conſiſt upon other matter, for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing himſelf from the obedience of the Queen, which is an offence out of the compaſs of the ſaid <hi>Proviſo,</hi> and therefore the enquiry of it not reſtrained unto any time; and the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> extends to Bills, Writings, Inſtruments, &amp;c. and not to the words <hi>(with-drawing by words)</hi> which is ſupplied by 13 <hi>Eliz. (with-drawing by other means)</hi> and the reſtraint of the Enquiry at the time, goes to the hearing of Maſs, and ſaying of Maſs, and not <hi>(repairing to the Church;)</hi> but as to with-drawing, the ſame is at large, not reſtrained by that Statute: And he ſaid, that this Indictment doth conſiſt upon many offences, ſome to offences within the <hi>Proviſo,</hi> and as to thoſe the Indictment is void: Some to other offences, as Treaſon, the offence of with-drawing, the Enquiry of which is not reſtrained, and therefore this Indictment ſhall ſtand: Alſo it was the intent of this Statute, not to reſtrain this Court, but only the Iuſtices of Peace, for they are ſpecially named. <hi>Coke</hi> conceived, that this word <hi>Touching, &amp;c.</hi> did not extend to any thing contained in the Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> but only to offences within the Acts of 1, 5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which were incertain before; alſo this <hi>Proviſo</hi> is in the Diſjunctive, againſt this or againſt the Acts of 1, 5, or 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> ſo as that which follows is to be applied to the laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive, and not to the whole ſentence; and always when a thing is named certain, and after general things, the words ſubſequent ſhall be referred to the general words, and not to that which is certain. Alſo if <hi>(Touching, &amp;c.)</hi> doth refer to this Statute, the ſentence would have begun with it; but here it begins with the Supremacy, of which nothing is ſpoken in this Statute, and therefore it ought to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Statute which begins it, and that is 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and then it ſhall be prepoſterous to come after 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and theſe words <hi>(ſhall and may)</hi> ought to be ſo conſtrued, <hi>(ſhall)</hi> is reſtrictive of it ſelf, and <hi>(may)</hi> ſhall be referred to that which was reſtrained before, as the proceedings upon the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 2. were reſtrained to the next She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs; And he conceived, that this Court is as well reſtrained to Time as any other Court, for the words are as well before Iuſtices of the Peace, as before other Iuſtices named in the ſaid Statutes, and in the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> this Court is eſpecially named: <hi>Wray,</hi> This <hi>Proviſo</hi> begins with Iuſtices of the Peace, therefore it doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to offences which are Treaſon; and the meaning of this Statute of 23 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was to enlarge the Statutes of 1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> for where the offence againſt the Statutes before was to be enquired at the next Seſſion, and the other within ſix Months; now by this Statute it may be enquired at any time within the year and day, but it doth not extend to reſtrain the proceedings againſt offences of Treaſon, for the words of the Statute are, That ſuch offences ſhall be inquired before Iuſtices of Peace within a year, &amp;c. But in the next clauſe, the Iuſtices of Peace may puniſh all offences againſt this Act, but Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by which it appeareth that no offences are reſtrained to time, but thoſe which the Iuſtices of the Peace have authority to hear and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and that is not Treaſon: <hi>Gawdy</hi> to the ſame purpoſe: For all the <hi>Proviſo</hi> is but one ſentence, and there the whole ſhall be referred to ſpiritual offences, as the not coming to Church, &amp;c.</p>

A.</hi> makes a Feoffment in fee to the uſe of himſelf for life, and after to the uſe of <hi>B.</hi> who he intendeth to marry, until the Iſſue which he ſhall beget on her ſhall be of the age of <hi>21</hi> years, and after the Iſſue ſhall come of ſuch age, then unto the uſe of the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> during her Widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, the Husband dieth without Iſſue, the Wife entreth, and her En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try holden lawful.

And alſo this is by way of uſe, which needs not to depend upon any eſtate, and if the Remainder ſhall veſt preſently upon his return, then it would be doubtful what Remainder it is, if it be a Remainder depending upon the eſtate for the life of <hi>Ann</hi> and <hi>Muriel,</hi> or for years, <hi>i.e.</hi> until <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſhall come of the age of <hi>21</hi> years: But be it incertain, yet the Fine is good, for here is a Remainder in <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and both are but particular eſtates, and there is not any doubt, but that one may convey by Fine, or bar by Fine ſuch contingent uſes, for which ſee the Statute of <hi>32 H. 8.</hi> All Fines to be levied of any Lands intailed in any wiſe to him that levieth the Fine, or to any his Anceſtors in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, reverſion, &amp;c. which word <hi>(uſe)</hi> goes to contingent uſes, for at the time of the making of that Statute, there was no other uſe. <hi>Fenner</hi> Iuſtice remembred the Caſe adjudged <hi>M. 30 &amp; 31 Eliz.</hi> betwixt <hi>Johnſon</hi> and <hi>Bellamy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Len. 36.</note> which ruled this Caſe. <hi>Gawdy</hi> Iuſtice, Here is a certainty upon which the Remainder doth depend, <hi>i. e.</hi> the death of <hi>Ambroſe;</hi> but the Caſe had been the more doubtful if no certainty at all had been in the Caſe. <hi>Atkinſon</hi> contrary; Here the Lord <hi>Vaux</hi> is Tenant for life, the Remainder to <hi>George</hi> in tail; now when the Lord <hi>Vaux</hi> levies a Fine, this is a forfeiture, and then the Entry of <hi>George</hi> is lawful. It hath been objected on the other ſide, that this Remainder was future and contingent, and not veſted, therefore nothing paſſed to <hi>George</hi> by <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> The words are (<hi>quouſque Ambroſe</hi> ſhall return.) This word <hi>(quouſque)</hi> is a word of Limitation, and not of Condition, and then the Remainder may well riſe when the Limitation hapneth. It hath been ſaid, that this Remainder is contingent, and then the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which is to veſt upon a contingency, cannot be granted or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited before that the contingent hapneth: And he cited the Caſe of <hi>14 Eliz. 314. Dyer.</hi> A Fine is levied to <hi>A.</hi> to the uſe of <hi>B.</hi> for life, the Remainder to <hi>E.</hi> in Tail, the Remainder to <hi>B.</hi> in fee. <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That if <hi>B.</hi> ſhall have Iſſue of his Body, that then after ſuch Iſſue, and <hi>500 l.</hi> paid to, &amp;c. within ſix months after the birth of ſuch iſſue, the uſe of the ſaid Lands, after the death of the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> and the ſaid ſix months ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, ſhall be to the ſaid <hi>B.</hi> and the heirs of his body: And it was holden, that before the ſaid contingent hapneth, <hi>B.</hi> had not any eſtate tail, for there it was incertain if the ſaid contingent would happen; but in our caſe, the contingents or ſome of them will happen, or run out by effluxion of time, and that makes the Remainder certain in <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> And he alſo argued, that the Limitations are ſeveral, by reaſon of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:53034:129"/>
and the laſt part of the ſentence, and that the ſaid ſentence is in the Disjunctive appeareth by the ſubſequent words (which of the ſaid days or times ſhall firſt happen) And then the return of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> (for that firſt hapned) veſts the Remainder in him, and therefore the Plaintiff ought to be barred. <hi>Buckley</hi> contrary: The eſtate of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters doth depend upon a Copulative, <hi>i.e.</hi> the return of <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and his full age, and both is but one Limitation; it is clear, that the firſt Limitation is upon a contingent, and the remainder cannot veſt until both are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And as to that which hath been ſaid, that there is a certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation, <hi>i. e.</hi> the return of <hi>Ambroſe, 18 Eliz.</hi> the Caſe was, Lands were giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Husband and Wife, the Remainder to ſuch of them as ſhould ſurvive the other, for years, the Husband makes a Leaſe for years and dieth, it was holden, that although the Limitation was upon a certain eſtate, yet becauſe it is not known in which of the parties the eſtate ſecondly limited ſhall begin, the Leaſe is void; So here it is not certainly appointed when the eſtate limited to <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſhall begin, upon the return, full age, or death of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> and he ſaid, that here are but two times of Limitation, firſt return and full age, ſecond death; return and full age determines the eſtate of the Daughters, and alſo the death, if it ſhall firſt happen, and if theſe three times ſhall be conſtrued in the Disjunctive,<note place="margin">2 Len. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</note> the ſame would overthrow the eſtate of the Daughters, which is an eſtate for years determinable, upon the death of themſelves or <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> The laſt words of the Limitation do not diſtinguiſh or disjoyn it, but reſpect the eſtate precedent. And by <hi>Clench</hi> Iuſtice, If the uſe limited to <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> ſhall depend only upon the Limitation of his death, the ſame ſhould be void, for then he ſhould not he in <hi>eſſe</hi> to take. But the other Iuſtices were of a contrary opinion, and that the uſe is good, <hi>7 H. 4. Gawdy,</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that here be three things, yet but two times; for the words are not <hi>(or)</hi> at ſuch of the ſaid days or times, as ſhall firſt happen, for that would alter the caſe: But here theſe words ought to be intended as if they were ſpoken before in the Limitation of the eſtate to the Daughters, and cannot divide the former Limitation: and he ſaid, that if by reaſon, that the Limitation upon the death, which is certain, it ſhall veſt in <hi>Ambroſe</hi> preſently, then if after the other Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall fall, then his Remainder which veſted in him upon the ſaid certain Limitation ſhould be deveſted, and ſhould now accrue to him upon the other Limitation, which ſhould be abſurd and inconvenient, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was adjorned.</p>

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:53034:130"/>
                  <hi>Tanfeild</hi> argued for the Defendant, that the Biſhop had no cauſe to re-enter, for there is not any condition in the Caſe, but only a Covenant, for it comes in only on the part of the Leſſee, and they are words of Covenant only, whereas every condition ought to be the words of the Leſſor, and the Biſhop hath ſufficient remedy by Action of Covenant: But if the words had been indifferent and abſolute without depending on the Leſſor or Leſſee, then it had been otherwiſe, as 3 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Dyer,</hi> 65. <hi>Non licebit,</hi> to the Leſſee, <hi>dare, concedere, vel vendere ſtatum vel terminum,</hi> without the Licence of the Leſſor, under pain of forfeiture, the ſame is a good condition, but here it is meerly a Covenant, and it cannot be both. <hi>Haughton.</hi> Although the words ſound in Covenant, and be the words of the Leſſee, yet the Leaſe being made by Indenture, the ſame is the Deed of both, and every word in it is ſpoken by both parties, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that he may have an Action of Covenant, yet he cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by overthrow the Leaſe, as by Entry, by condition broken, and yet by the words it ſeems the meaning of the Indenture was, that by the breach of this Covenant, the eſtate ſhould be defeated, for ſo are the words, <hi>ſub poena forisfactur.</hi> And here by way of Action he cannot have the benefit of the whole Covenant, and therefore he ſhall have it by way of condition: And ſee the caſe betwixt <hi>Browning</hi> and <hi>Beſton, Plow.</hi> 132.

And ſuch was the opinion of <hi>Wray</hi> and <hi>Gawdy,</hi> and <hi>Fenner</hi> did not contradict it: Wherefore <hi>Tanfeild</hi> ſaid, Admit here it is a condition, yet here is not any breach of it ſufficiently ſet forth, for the breach is aſſigned becauſe he had put out a woman, <hi>unam tenentem, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitantem,</hi> out of certain Lands parcel of the ſaid Manor, late in the poſſeſſion and occupation of the ſaid woman, and that might be, that ſhe was but Tenant at Will, and the Covenant doth refer only to Copy-holders: And it may be alſo, that ſhe had diſſeiſed one of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the Manor, in which caſe, the putting out of ſuch a Tenant being in by wrong, is no breach of condition. Alſo it is not averred in <hi>facto,</hi> that <hi>Ann</hi> was Tenant of any part of the Mannor: Alſo the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication is, That the ſaid Defendant had ouſted the ſaid <hi>Ann,</hi> where ſhe had done her duty, <hi>fecit debitum ſuum,</hi> before the Ouſter, and that might be, that ſhe had done her duty once, but not after, and therefore he ought to have ſaid, that ſhe had done her duty always, before her putting out, and this word (duly) being ſingle, is too general, for it may be underſtood of curteſie, where the words in the Indenture are (Doing their duty according to the cuſtom of the Manor.)

                  <hi>WIlliam Dethick,</hi> againſt <hi>Garter</hi> King of Arms, was indicted upon the Statute of 5 <hi>E.</hi> 6. for ſtriking in the Church-yard: For that the ſaid <hi>Dethick</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> Church-yard in <hi>London,</hi> ſtruck <hi>I.S.</hi> It was moved; If Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral Churches be within the meaning of the Statute: The Court was clear of opinion, that they were. And afterwards the Defendant pleaded, that before the Indictment found, he was created and crowned by the Letters Patents of the Queen which he ſhewed, chief and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal King of Arms, and it was granted by the ſaid Letters Patents, that he ſhould be called <hi>Garter,</hi> and that that name is not in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment, and demanded Iudgment: The Kings Attorney by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication ſaid, That by the Law of Arms and Heraldry, every one who is made King of Arms before he receives his Dignity ought to be led betwixt two Officers of Arms, by the Arms, before the Earl Marſhal of <hi>England,</hi> or his Deputy, and before him are to go four Officers of Arms, whereof the one is to bear his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, another a Collar of Eſſes, the third a Coronet of Braſs double guilt, fourthly a Cup of Wine, and his Patent ſhall be read before the Earl Marſhal; and afterwards his Coronet ſhall be ſet upon his Head, and the Collar of Eſſes about his neck, and afterwards the Wine poured upon his Head: And that the Defendant had not received theſe Ceremonies, for which cauſe he is not King of Arms, nor to be
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:53034:131"/>
called upon, to which the Defendant did demur in Law. <hi>Broughton</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued for the Defendant, and he took Exception to the Replication, becauſe it is pleaded there, that <hi>ſecundum legem Heraldorum, Garter</hi> upon his Creation ought to receive, &amp;c. of which Law this Court cannot have Conuſance, and therefore the Replication ought to be, <hi>ſcil. Secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum legem Angliae:</hi> If in Appeal the Defendant wage Battel, although that belongs unto Arms and Heraldry, yet it ſhall be pleaded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Law of the Land, and ſhall not ſpeak of the Law of Arms. So if an Infant be made a Knight, and he be to plead in diſcharge of his Wardſhip, he ſhall plead according to the Law of the Land, and yet the degree of a Knight belongs to the Law of Arms, 11 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Dower againſt the Earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> who was alſo Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> who pleaded to the Writ, That he was Duke of <hi>Britain,</hi> and not ſo named in the Writ; but the Court did not regard it, for they cannot have knowledge of it, ſo not here of the Law of <hi>Heraldry:</hi> Alſo this Court cannot write to the <hi>Heralds</hi> to certifie it, as they may to the Marſhal of the King, or to the Biſhop: But we have ſufficiently ſhewed our matter, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That we have Letters Patents of the Queen, and that we were ſworn in the ſaid Office, and ſo we are King of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralds</hi> by matter of Record, againſt which is pleaded only matter in defect of ceremony and circumſtance, which is not material. An Earl is created with the ceremonies of putting a Sword broad-wiſe about his Body, and a Cap with a Coronet upon his Head. Yet the King may create an Earl without ſuch ceremonies: And may alſo create an Earl by word, if the ſame be after Recorded; when a Knight is made, Spurs ought to be put upon his Heels, yet without ſuch cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony ſuch degree may be conferred to and upon another, for ſuch ceremonies are or may be uſed, or not uſed at the Kings pleaſure. Afterwards it was objected, that the ſame is but a name of Office, but not a name of Dignity. To which it was anſwered, that this word <hi>Coronamus</hi> always imports Dignity, and this is a Dignity and Office, as Earl, Marqueſs, &amp;c. <hi>Fenner</hi> Iuſtice, The Patent is, <hi>Nomen tibi im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponimus,</hi> and therefore <hi>(Garter)</hi> is parcel of his Name: And therefore he ought to be Indicted by ſuch Name. And it ſhould be hard, to tye Eſtate and Degrees to ceremonies. <hi>Gawdy</hi> was of opinion, That this is but a name of Office, and therefore the Indictment good, as 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> Writ of Summons of Parliament iſſueth without theſe words <hi>(Supream Head)</hi> and the Writ was holden good, for it is not parcel of the Name, but addition only: So here, <hi>Fenner</hi> and <hi>Wray</hi> contrary, for the words are <hi>Creamus, Coronamus, Nomen imponimus, Ergo,</hi> part of his Name, which <hi>Clench</hi> alſo granted, and afterwards <hi>Dethick</hi> was diſcharged.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Covenant.</note>IN an Action of Covenant, the Plaintiff declared, that <hi>Charles Grice</hi> and <hi>Heſter</hi> his Wife were ſeiſed of certain Tenements calle <hi>Withons,</hi> with divers Lands to the ſame appertaining, and of another parcel of Land called <hi>Dole,</hi> containing eight Acres, to them and the heirs of the body of the ſaid <hi>Charks</hi> on the body of the ſaid <hi>Heſter</hi> his wife lawfully begotten, and ſo ſeiſed, 15 <hi>Eliz.</hi> leaſed the ſame to the Defendant by Indenture for years, by which Indenture the Leſſor covenanted, that the Leſſee ſhould have ſufficient Houſe-boot, Fencing-wood, and Hoop-wood upon the Lands during the Term; and that further the Leſſee covenanted for him, his Executors and Aſſigns, with the Leſſor, &amp;c. That it ſhould be lawful for them to enter upon the Lands during the ſaid Term, and to have egreſs and regreſs there, and to cut down and diſpoſe of all the Wood and Timber there growing, leaving ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Houſe-boot, Fencing-wood and Hoop-wood to the Leſſee, upon the Lands called the <hi>Dole,</hi> for his expences at <hi>Withons;</hi> and further, that he would not take any Wood or Timber upon the Premiſſes, without the aſſent or aſſigment of the Leſſor or his Aſſigns, otherwiſe than according to the Indenture and true meaning thereof. And further declared, That the ſaid <hi>Charles</hi> and his Wife ſo ſeiſed, levied a Fine of part of the Land to <hi>R. S.</hi> and his heirs, to whom the Defendant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torned, and that the ſaid <hi>R.S.</hi> afterwards deviſed the ſame to <hi>I.</hi> his Wife, the now Plaintiff for years, the Remainder over to another, and died, and that the Defendant had felled and carried out of the Lands cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Withons,</hi> twenty loads of Wood without the aſſent and aſſignment of the Leſſor or his Aſſigns, for which the Plaintiff as Aſſignee brought the Action. The Defendant pleaded, That after the Leaſe <hi>John Grice</hi> and others by aſſignment of <hi>Heſter</hi> had cut down and carried away fifty loads of Wood in the ſaid Lands called the <hi>Dole,</hi> and ſo they had not left ſufficient Woods for his expences at <hi>Withons</hi> according to the Indenture, for which cauſe he took the ſaid twenty loads of Wood upon <hi>Withons</hi> for his expences, upon which the Plaintiff did demur in Law. <hi>Godfrey,</hi> The Plea is not good; This Plea is no more, but that ſufficient Wood was not left upon the <hi>Dole</hi> for his expences, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be not, yet the Defendant cannot cut Wood elſewhere, for he hath reſtrained himſelf by the Covenant. Alſo the Covenant of the Leſſor is, That the Leſſee ſhall have ſufficient Wood upon the <hi>Dole</hi> for his expences at <hi>Withons,</hi> but in his ſatisfaction he doth not alledge, that he had need of Wood for to ſpend at <hi>Withons,</hi> nor doth aver that he hath ſpent it there, for otherwiſe he hath not cauſe to take, &amp;c. And the meaning was, that the Leſſee ſhould have ſufficient Wood when he had need of it. <hi>Hobart</hi> for the Defendant, He would not ſpeak to the Plea in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:53034:132"/>
Bar; but he conceived that the Declaration was not good, for here no breach of Covenant is aſſigned, for the Covenant is in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That the Defendant ſhould not take Wood without the aſſent or aſſignment of the Leſſor or his Aſſigns: And the Plaintiff chargeth the Defendant with cutting of Wood without the aſſent and aſſignment of the Leſſor, ſo he would compel us to prove more than we ought, for if he did it with their aſſent only, or by their aſſignment only, it is ſufficient; but if the Covenant had been in the copulative, both was neceſſary: And for the nature of Copulatives he cited the Caſe, where two Churchwardens bring an Action of Treſpaſs, the Defendant pleads, That the Plaintiffs are not Churchwardens, upon which they are at Iſſue. The Iury find, That the one was Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warden, and the other not, and for that the Plaintiffs could not have Iudgment, for if the one of them be not Churchwarden, then the Plaintiffs are not Churchwardens, for the copulatives ought not to be disjoyned: And he cited the caſe lately ruled in the Common Pleas betwixt <hi>Ognel</hi> and <hi>Underwood</hi> concerning <hi>Crucifield Grange, A.</hi> leaſed unto <hi>B.</hi> certain Lands for forty years, <hi>B.</hi> leaſed part of the ſame to <hi>C.</hi> for ten years. <hi>A.</hi> grants a Rent-charge out of the Lands <hi>in tenura &amp; occupatione B.</hi> It was reſolved, That the Lands leaſed to <hi>C.</hi> ſhould not be charged with that Rent, for although it was <hi>in tenura B.</hi> yet it was not in his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation, and both are exquiſite becauſe in the copulative: So here, the Leſſee may cut Wood with the aſſent of the Leſſor without any aſſignment. Alſo here, the ſubſtance of the covenant cannot charge the Defendant, for although it be in the Negative, yet it is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in the Negative, but doth refer unto the covenant precedent; for the words are, That the Leſſee ſhall not cut Woods, <hi>aliter quam,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the intent of the Indenture, where the covenant precedent is not, that the Leſſee ſhall not cut Woods but in the <hi>Dole,</hi> but that the Leſſor might cut down any Trees in the <hi>Dole</hi> leaving ſufficient for the Leſſee, which covenant in it ſelf doth not reſtrain the Leſſee to cut down any Trees in any part of the Lands demiſed, nor abridgeth the power which the Law giveth to him by reaſon of the demiſe. Then when this laſt covenant comes, <hi>i. e.</hi> That the Leſſee will not cut, <hi>aliter,</hi> then according to the meaning of the Indenture without the aſſent, &amp;c. the ſame doth not reſtrain him from the power which the meaning of the Indenture gives, and ſo no breach of covenant can be aſſigned in this. For by virtue of the Leaſe, the Leſſee of common Right may take neceſſary Fuel upon any part of the Land leaſed: Alſo this firſt covenant being in the Affirmative doth not abridge any Intereſt, as 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 19. The Leſſor covenants, That the Leſſee ſhall have ſufficient Hedge-boot by aſſignment of the Baily. It is holden by <hi>Baldwin</hi> and <hi>Shelley,</hi> That the Leſſee may take it without aſſignment, becauſe there are no Negative words, <hi>&amp; non aliter.</hi> So 8 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 10. A Rent of ten pounds was granted to Husband and Wife, and if the Husband overlive his Wife that he ſhall have three pounds Rent, and if the Wife do over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live the Husband, ſhe ſhall have forty ſhillings, there it was holden that the Rent of ten pounds continued, not reſtrained by the ſeverance of any of them. And although peradventure it appeareth here, that the meaning of the parties was, That the Leſſee ſhould not cut down any Wood but in the <hi>Dole,</hi> yet foraſmuch as ſuch meaning doth not ſtand with the Law, it ſhall be rejected, as it was holden to be in the caſe betwixt <hi>Benet</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> where a man ſeiſed of divers Lands, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed parcel of it called <hi>Gages,</hi> to the erecting of a School, and another parcel unto <hi>B.</hi> in fee, and all his other Lands unto one <hi>French</hi> in Fee, The deviſe of <hi>Gages</hi> was holden void, becauſe too general, for no perſon is named; and it was further holden, that it paſſed by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deviſe to <hi>French,</hi> and yet that was not the meaning of the Deviſor: Alſo the Plaintiff is not Aſſignee but of parcel of the Reverſion, for if
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:53034:133"/>
the Reverſion is granted to him for years,<note place="margin">Owen Rep. 152. 1 Co. 215.</note> and ſuch Aſſignee cannot have an Action of Covenant, for a Covenant is a thing in Action, and annexed to the Reverſion, ſo that if the Reverſion doth not continue in its firſt courſe as it was at the time of the creation of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but be altered or divided, the Covenant is deſtroyed, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was holden, 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. betwixt <hi>Wiſeman</hi> and <hi>Warringer,</hi> where a Leaſe for years was made of one hundred Acres of Lands, rendring ten pound Rent, and afterwards the Leſſor granted fifty Acres of it, that the Grantee ſhould not have any part of the Rent, but all the Rent was deſtroyed.

And of that opinion were all the three Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, for the Conuſors took by ſeveral Acts, and the Eſtate is charged, for it cometh under the Grant. <hi>Fenner</hi> Iuſtice, There is a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt a Rent ſervice and a Rent-charge, or Common, for that ſhall charge only the Poſſeſſion, but a Rent-charge ſhall charge the whole Eſtate: And therefore if he who hath a Rent-ſervice releaſeth to him in the Remainder upon an Eſtate-tail, or for life, the Rent is extinct; which <hi>Gawdy</hi> denied: And this Caſe was put, The Diſſeiſee doth releaſe to the Leſſee for years of his Diſſeiſor, <hi>nihil operatur:</hi> But if the Diſſeiſor and Diſſeiſee joyn in a Releaſe to ſuch Leſſee, the ſame is good, for firſt it ſhall enure as the Releaſe of the Diſſeiſor, and then of the Diſſeiſee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

As to the regreſs of the Feoffees, <hi>Geofries</hi> was of opinion, That where an uſe is limited to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon certain, and thereupon veſted in the perſon to whom it is limited, That the Entry of the Feoffees in ſuch caſe is not requiſite, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the firſt eſtates be diſcontinued, but where the uſe (as in our caſe) is not limited to a perſon certain in <hi>eſſe,</hi> but is in abeyance, not veſted in any perſon upon the limitation of it, ſome eſtate ought to be left in the Feoffees to maintain that uſe, and to render it according to the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53034:136"/>
and in our caſe, theſe uſes not in <hi>eſſe</hi> at the time of the making of the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. could not be executed by the ſaid Statute, but now at the appointed time by the limitation ſhall be raiſed and revived by the Entry of the Feoffees, but here by the Fine and <hi>Non</hi>-claim, the Feoffees are bound, and their Entry taken away, and ſo no uſe can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue to <hi>Percival Hart</hi> by ſuch Entry. <hi>Southcote</hi> Iuſtice was of opinion, that the Feoffees cannot enter at all, becauſe that by the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. nothing is left in them at the time of the making of the Statute, which ſaves the right of every perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> other than the Feoffees, ſo as no right is ſaved to them but all is drawn out of them by the operation of the Statute, and the ſecond ſaving of the Statute, ſaves to the Feoffees all their former Right, ſo as the Right which the Feoffees had by the Feoffment to the uſe is utterly gone. But <hi>Percival Hart</hi> may well enter, for he is not bound to the five years after the Fine levied, for he had not right at the time of the Fine levied, but his right came by the Fine. <hi>Wray</hi> chief Iuſtice, The Feoffees are not to enter, for the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath two branches, 1. gives the poſſeſſion to <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> in ſuch manner as he hath in the uſe. 2. takes away all the right out of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees, and gives it to <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> ſo as nothing at all remains in the Feoffees; for if an Act of Parliament will give to me all the Lands, whereof my brother <hi>Southcote</hi> is ſeiſed, and that I ſhall be in the Seiſin thereof, now is the actual poſſeſſion in me without my Entry: ſo where an uſe is often executed by the Statute, <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> without any Entry hath an actual poſſeſſion. <hi>i.</hi> As to the uſes contingent, nothing remains in the Feoffees for the ſetling of them when they happen, but the whole eſtate is ſetled in <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> yet ſubject to ſuch uſe, and he ſhall render the ſame upon contingency: And if any eſtate ſhould remain in the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offees, it could be but an eſtate for life, for the Fee ſimple is executed in <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> with an eſtate in poſſeſſion, and then the Feoffees ſhould be ſeiſed to another uſe than was given them by the Livery. Alſo if a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offment be made unto the uſe of the Feoffor, and his heirs, until <hi>J.S.</hi> hath paid unto the Feoffor 100 <hi>l.</hi> from thenceforth the Feoffor and his heirs ſhall be ſeiſed to the uſe of the ſaid <hi>J.S.</hi> and his heirs, if upon ſuch Feoffment any thing ſhould remain in the Feoffees before the payment by <hi>I.S.</hi> the ſame ſhould be a Fee-ſimple, and then there ſhould be two Fee-ſimples of one and the ſame Lands, one in the Feoffor, and the other in the Feoffees, which ſhould be abſurd, and therefore the beſt way to avoid ſuch inconveniences is to continue the Statute, that it draws the whole eſtate of the Land, and alſo the confidence out of the Feoffees, and repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it upon the Lands, the which by the operation of the Statute, ſhall render the uſe to every perſon in his time according to the limitation of the parties: And alſo if any Intereſt doth remain in the Feoffees, Then if they convey to any perſon upon conſideration who hath not notice of the uſe, then the ſaid uſe ſhall never riſe, which is utterly againſt the meaning of the ſaid Statute, and the meaning of the parties, and therefore, to conſtrue the Statute, to leave nothing in the Feoffees will prevent all ſuch miſchief: And if a Feoffment in fee be made to the uſe of the Feoffor for life, and afterwards to the uſe of his wife which ſhall be for life, and afterwards to the uſe of the right Heirs of the Feoffor; The Feoffor enfeoffeth a ſtranger, taketh a wife, now cannot the Feof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fees enter during the life of the Feoffor, and after his death they cannot enter, becauſe they could not enter when the uſe to the wife was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin upon the intermarriage, and then if the Entry of the Feoffees in ſuch caſe ſhould be requiſite, the uſe limited to the wife by the Act of the Feoffor ſhould be deſtroyed againſt his own limitation, which is ſtrong againſt the meaning of the Act aforeſaid, for by the ſaid act, the Land is credited with the ſaid uſe, which ſhall never fail in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it.

That upon Recovery in Debt, if the Defendant in delay of Execution ſues a Writ of Error, and the Iudgment be affirmed, he ſhall pay damages, now the caſe was, That one in Execution brought ſuch a Writ of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the firſt Iudgment is affirmed, he ſhall pay damages, and yet here is not any delay of the Execution, for the Defendant was in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution before, but here is an Interruption of the Execution, and the Statute did intend the Execution it ſelf, <hi>i.</hi> the continuance in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>ibidem moraturus quouſque:</hi> It was ſaid on the other ſide, That the converſion and continuance thereof are two ſeveral things, each by it ſelf, and ſo the converſion only being excepted in the pardon, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance thereof remains in the grace of the pardon: And it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the Statute of 2, and 3. <hi>Ph. &amp; Ma.</hi> That converſion, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance are not the ſame, but <hi>alia, atque diverſa,</hi> and diſtinct things in the conſideration of the Law; for there it is enacted, That if any perſon ſhall have any Lands to be holden in Tillage according to the ſaid Statute, but converted to Paſture by any other perſon, the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have authority by the ſaid Statute to enjoyn ſuch perſons to convert ſuch Lands to Tillage again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in all caſes in the Law, there is a great difference betwixt the beginning of a wrong, and the continuance of it: As if the Father levyeth a Nuſance in his own Lands to the offence of another and dyeth; an Aſſize of Nuſance doth not lye againſt the Heir for the continuance of that wrong, but a <hi>Quod permittat,</hi> See <hi>F.N.B.</hi> 124.

further than the Deputy: It was argued that the eſtate granted, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> was void, for a Deputy cannot transfer his authority over, for it is an office of truſt: See 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 33, 34. 14 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 1. and 6 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, That the Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi> had divers Stewards of his Lands, and they, in the name of the ſaid Duke made diverſe Leaſes of the Lands of the ſaid Duke, rendring Rent, and the Duke, afterwards aſſented to the ſaid Leaſes, and received the Rents reſerved upon them, and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the death of the ſaid Duke, the Earl of <hi>Hertford</hi> his Son and Heir avoided them: So here, the aſſent, and the ſubſignment of the copy by the Lord <hi>Dacres,</hi> doth not give any ſtrength to the copy which was void at the beginning; againſt which it was ſaid, That to take a Surrender, and to grant an Eſtate by copy is not any judicial Act, but meerly an Act of ſervice, and no matter of truſt is transferred to <hi>Hardy,</hi> for truſt is repoſed in him who may deceive, which can't be in our Caſe, for here is an expreſs commandment, which if <hi>Hardy</hi> tranſgreſs it is abſolute void, for nothing is left to his diſcretion: And the admitting of a Copy-holder is not any judicial Act, for there need not be any of the Suitors there who are the Iudges: And ſuch a Court may be holden out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct of the Manor, for no Pleas are holden, which was <hi>conceſſum per to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam Curiam:</hi> And by <hi>Ayliff</hi> Iuſtice, If the Lord of ſuch a Manor makes a Feoffment of a parcel of his Manor which is holden by copy for life, and afterwards the Copy-holder dyeth, although now the Lord hath not any Court, yet the Feoffee may grant over the Land by copy again.

                  <note place="margin">Error.</note> upon a Recovery had in a Writ of Diſceit by the ſaid Biſhop and <hi>Blower</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Powell,</hi> for that the ſaid <hi>Williams</hi> had before brought a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> againſt the ſaid <hi>Blower</hi> and the Biſhop,<note place="margin">Dyer 353. b. 354.</note> and had recovered againſt them by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault, whereupon <hi>Williams</hi> had a Writ to the Metropolitan to admit his Clerk, and in the Writ of Diſceit Iudgment was given for the Plaintiffs: For it was found, That the Summons was the Friday to appear the Tuesday after, and ſo an inſufficient Summons, and in that Writ of Diſceit the Defendants, <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Powell</hi> pleaded, That <hi>Blower</hi> the Incumbent was deprived of his Benefice in the Court of Audience, which ſentence was affirmed upon Appeal before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates; and notwithſtanding that Plea, Iudgment was given againſt <hi>Williams</hi> and <hi>Powell</hi> Defendants in the ſaid Writ of Diſceit: And upon that Iudgment this Writ of Error is brought. <hi>Beaumont</hi> aſſigned four Errors, Firſt,<note place="margin">1 Cro. 65.</note> becauſe the Biſhop and <hi>Blower</hi> joyned in the Writ of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, for their Rights are ſeveral, 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 6.

By <hi>Wood.</hi> So if Lands be given to two, and to the Heirs of one, and they loſe by default in a <hi>Praecipe</hi> brought againſt them, they ſhall have ſeveral Writs, the one <hi>Quod ei deforceat,</hi>

The ſecond Error was, Becauſe the Bar of the Defendants in the Writ of Diſceit was good, <hi>i.</hi> the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation, &amp;c. and the Court adjudged it not good, for the Clerk being deprived, he could not enjoy the Benefice, if the Iudgment in the <hi>Qu.

by erronious Iudgment; <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> dieth, his Writ of Error is gone, for if the Iudgment be reverſed he cannot be reſtored to the Land, for the eſtate is determined, 31 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Incumbent</hi> 6. The King brought a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> againſt the Incumbent and the Biſhop, the Biſhop claimed nothing but as Ordinary: The Incumbent traverſed the title of the King, againſt which it was replyed for the King, That the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent had reſigned pendant the Writ, ſo as now he could not plead any thing againſt the title of the King, for he had not poſſeſſion, and ſo could not counterplead the poſſeſſion of the King. And here in our Caſe, by this deprivation the Incumbent is diſabled to maintain this Action of Diſceit, 15 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 8. If the Guardian of a Chappel be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaded in a <hi>Praecipe</hi> for the Lands of his Chappel, and pendant the Writ he reſign, the Succeſſor ſhall have a Writ of Error, and not he who reſigns, for he is not to be reſtored to the Lands, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his Chappel. So in our Caſe, A deprivation is as ſtrong as a Reſignation. The third Error, becauſe in the Writ of Diſceit, it is not ſet forth that <hi>Blower</hi> was Incumbent, for the Writ of Diſceit ought to contain all the ſpecial matter of the Caſe; as an Action upon the Caſe, 4 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſceit</hi> 45. The fourth Error, That upon ſuggeſtion made after Verdict, that <hi>Blower</hi> was Incumbent, and in, of the preſentment of the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deprivation.</note> and that he was removed; and <hi>Griffin</hi> in by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery in the <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> by default, a Writ to the Biſhop was award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt <hi>Griffin,</hi> for he is poſſeſſor, and ſo the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. calls him, and gives him authority to plead againſt the King,<note place="margin">6 Co. 52.</note> and every Releaſe or Confirmation made to him is good, 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Confirmation made by the King after Recovery againſt the Incumbent is good: And 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7. If a Recovery be had in a <hi>Contra formam collationis,</hi> the poſſeſſor ſhall not be ouſted without a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> ſo in <hi>Audita Querela</hi> upon a Statute Staple,<note place="margin">Scire facias.</note> 
                  <hi>Scire facias</hi> ſhall go againſt the Aſſignee of the Conuſee, 15 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Reſpon.</hi> 1. See alſo 16 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Diſceit</hi> 35. 21 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 13. A Fine levied of Lands in Ancient Demeſn ſhall not be reverſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt the Ter-tenant. <hi>Walmeſley</hi> contrary, The caſe at the Bar differs from the caſe put of the other ſide, for they are caſes put upon original Writs, but our caſe is upon a judicial Writ, and here nothing is demanded, but the Defendant is only to anſwer to the diſceit and falſhood. And in this Caſe the Iſſue is contained in the Writ which is not in any original Writ, and the Iudges ſhall examine the iſſue without any plea or appearance of the Tenant, and here the Defendant is not to plead any thing to excuſe himſelf of the wrong: And here the Iudgment is not to recover any thing in demand, but only to reſtore the party to his former eſtate and poſſeſſion, and if he hath nothing, he ſhall be reſtored to nothing; And he put many caſes where perſons who have ſeveral Rights may joyn in one Action, as a Recovery in an Aſſize againſt ſeveral Tenants, they may joyn in one Writ of Error, 18 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> Recovery in Aſſize againſt Diſſeiſor and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, they ſhall both joyn in Error, why not alſo in Diſceit? 19 <hi>E.</hi> 3. Recovery againſt two Coparceners, the Survivor and the heir of the other ſhall joyn in Error. As to the ſecond Error, <hi>Williams</hi> and the Sheriff ought not to joyn in the Plea, and alſo the Plea it ſelf is not good, for the Writ of Diſceit is, That <hi>Williams</hi> anſwer to the Diſceit, and the Sheriff ſhall certifie the proceedings, and therefore he ſhall not plead: and alſo the Plea it ſelf is not good, for although the intereſt of the Incumbent be determined in the Church, yet his Action is not gone; as if in a <hi>Praecipe quod reddat,</hi> the Tenant alieneth pendant the Writ, and afterwards the Demandant recovereth, yet the Tenant although his Intereſt be gone by the Feoffment, yet he ſhall have a Writ of Error, and ſo here; and as to the <hi>Scire facias,</hi> there needs none here againſt the new Incumbent, for he comes in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

And this Condition annexed or tied to the uſe by the Will is now knit to the poſſeſſion, which is transferred to the uſe by the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute: Although it may be objected, that the Condition was annexed to the uſe, and now the uſe is extinct in the poſſeſſion, and by conſequence the Condition annexed unto it, as where a Seignory is granted upon Condition, and afterwards the Tenancy eſcheats, now the Seignory is extinct, and ſo the Condition annexed to it: But as to that it may be anſwered, That our Caſe cannot be reſembled to the Caſes at Common Law, but reſts upon the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>ſcil. Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> ſhall ſtand and be ſeiſed, deemed and adjudged in lawful ſeiſin, eſtate and poſſeſſion of and in ſuch Lands to all intents, conſtructions and purpoſes in Law, of an in ſuch like eſtates as he had in the uſe, and that the eſtate, right, title, and poſſeſſion that was in the Feoffee ſhall be clearly deemed and adjudged to be in <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> after ſuch qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, manner, form and condition as he had in the uſe: And therefore in the common aſſurance by bargain and ſale by Deed enrolled, if ſuch aſſurance be made upon Condition: As in caſe of Mortgage, the poſſeſſion is not raiſed by the Bargainee; but by the Bargain an uſe is raiſed to the Bargainee, and the poſſeſſion executed to it by the Statute, and the Condition which was annexed to the uſe only is now conjoyned to the poſſeſſion, and ſo it hath been adjudged. So if the Feoffees to uſe before the Statute had made a Leaſe for life, the Leſſee commits Waſt, the Statute comes, now <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe</hi> which was, ſhall have an Action to Waſt, as it was ajudged in Iuſtice <hi>Southcotes</hi> caſe:<note place="margin">

Ioynture to his Wife, now he hath exceeded his allowance, for he might have made a Ioynture to his wife indefeiſable by Fine upon a Grant upon a Render for life, &amp;c. But this Fine with the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is a Bar to the former entail which was created by the Deviſe, and hath created a new entail, and the former tail was barred by the Fine againſt the intent of the Deviſor: Alſo by this Fine he hath created a new Remainder, ſo as his Iſſue inheritable to his new en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail might alien and be unpuniſhed, which was againſt the meaning of the Deviſor: And as to the Leaſe for lives to the Defendants, the ſame is not any breach of the Condition, for that is warranted by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which enables Tenant in tail to make ſuch a Leaſe, ſo as it cannot be ſaid Diſcontinuance, which <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Periam</hi> granted: But the Fine levied after is a breach of the Condition, and then the Re-entry upon the Leſſees, who have their eſtates under the Condition is lawful: As where the wife of the Feoffee upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is endowed, and afterwards the Condition is broken, now by the Re-entry of the Feoffor the Dower is defeated. And <hi>Shutleworth</hi> put this caſe, A Feoffment is made upon Condition, that the Feoffee ſhall leaſe the Lands to <hi>A.</hi> for life, and afterwards grant the Reverſion to <hi>B.</hi> in Fee, the Feoffor may re-enter, for by this Conveyance he in the Reverſion is immediate Tenant to the Lord, where, by the intended aſſurance, the particular Tenant ought to be. <hi>Puckering, Fenner,</hi> and <hi>Walmeſley</hi> contrary: And by <hi>Walmeſley,</hi> By this deviſe the uſe only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and not the Land it ſelf, for the Statute of 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. extends only to Acts executed in the life of <hi>Ceſtuy que uſe,</hi> and not to deviſes which are not executed till after the death of the Deviſor, which ſee 4 <hi>Ma.

And he conceived, That the Condition is not broken by this Act, for the intent of the Deviſor is purſued, for his meaning was, That the wife ſhould have a Ioynture indefeiſable againſt the iſſue in tail, and that the inheritance ſhould be preſerved; that both ſhould be obſerved: And he ſaid, that this Fine being levied by him in the Reverſion upon an eſtate for life is not any diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but yet ſhall bar the eſtate Tail. And the Iuſtices were clear of opinion, that the Condition is broken, and alſo that the intent of the Condition is broken; for it might be that <hi>Charles</hi> had iſſue by a former wife, which by this Fine ſhould be diſinherited, and a new Entail ſet on foot againſt the meaning of the Deviſor, &amp;c. and afterwards Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>

And <hi>Periam</hi> Iuſtice denied the Caſe put by <hi>Puckering: A.</hi> morgages Lands to <hi>B.</hi> upon a uſurious contract for one hundred pounds, and before the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>B.</hi> is ouſted by <hi>C.</hi> againſt whom <hi>B.</hi> brings an Action, <hi>C.</hi> cannot plead the Statute of Vſury, for he hath no title: For the eſtate is void againſt the Mortgagor. Another Exception was taken to the Declaration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Plaintiff had declared, upon a Leaſe by the Warden and Fellows, without naming any name of the Warden, 13 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. 18 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 8. In Treſpaſs the Defendant doth juſtifie, becauſe that the Free-hold was in the Dean and Chapter, and he as Servant, and by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment entred; And Exception was taken to that Plea, becauſe he hath not ſhewed the name of the Dean, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the proper name: So if a Leaſe be made by Dean and Chapter in theſe words, <hi>Nos Decan. &amp; Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuli,</hi> the ſame Leaſe is void, which was granted by the Court: and 12 <hi>H.</hi> 4251.

Where Debt is brought by the Dean and Chapter without any Chriſtian name, and the Writ holden good: <hi>Anderſon:</hi> It ſtands with reaſon, That for as much as the Colledge was incorporated by the name of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Fellows, and not by any Chriſtian name that they may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and leaſe by ſuch name without any Chriſtian name, and may be impleaded, and implead others by ſuch name, and as the Fellows in ſuch caſe need not to be named by their Chriſtian names, no more ought the Warden: But of a Parſon, Vicar, Chauntry Prieſt, it is otherwiſe, for in ſuch caſe the name of Baptiſm ought to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:

It was alſo objected, That becauſe the Letter of Attorney was to enter in the Manor, and all the Lands and Tenements of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in ſuch a Town, and to ſeal the Indenture of Leaſe in the name of the Leſſors, and to deliver it to the Plaintiff as their Deed; now the Attorney in executing of this Warrant hath not purſued it, for he hath only entred into the Lands, but it is not found that he entred into the Manor, and ſo the Leaſe is void. And it was ſaid by <hi>Puckering,</hi> That if I leaſe two Acres in two ſeveral Counties, rendring for the one Acre 10 <hi>s.</hi> and for the other Acre 10 <hi>s.</hi> and make a Letter of Attorney to make Livery in both; if the Attorney entreth into one Acre and makes Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, the ſame is void, for the Attorney hath not purſued his authority, for peradventure I would not have leaſed the Acre whereof Livery is made for ſuch rent of 10 <hi>s.</hi> being perhaps of greater value, but with the other Acre which was of leſſer value, and ſo the miſ-executing of my warrant ſhall prejudice me. <hi>Windham,</hi> Perhaps if one entire Rent had been reſerved out of both Acres, it may be that by the Livery in one Acre all is void: But by <hi>Puckering,</hi> one entire Rent cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved upon ſuch a Leaſe of two Acres in ſeveral Counties. <hi>Walmeſley</hi> denied the Caſe put by <hi>Puckering,</hi> for the authority is executed well enough, for it doth not appear upon the Verdict, but that the Colledge was in poſſeſſion at the time of the Leaſe made, and then there needed not any ſuch Entry, but the bare ſealing and delivery of the Attorney is good enough. And alſo it doth not appear by Verdict, That the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge hath any Manor, and therefore it ſhall be ſo intended; and then the Caſe is no other but that, A man leaſeth a Manor, and certain Lands in <hi>D.</hi> and makes a Letter of Attorney to make Livery of them, where he hath nothing in the Manor, and the Attorney makes Livery of the Land without medling with the Manor, the ſame is a good Livery, and the authority duly executed: But if it had been expreſly found, that the Colledge had ſuch a Manor there, then the Entry in the Land only, without medling with the Manor, and the Livery made accordingly, ſhould not be good: But yet afterwards he ſeemed to be of other opinion. And as to that which hath been objected, That the Leaſe is void to all intents and purpoſes, according to the words of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute (for by ſome it cannot be reſembled to the caſe cited before, of the Biſhop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Lichfeild,</hi> that ſuch a Grant ſhould bind him and not his Succeſſors;) for if this Grant in our Caſe ſhall not be void preſently, it ſhall never be void; for the Colledge never dieth no more than Dean and Chapter, Mayor and Commonalty. To that it was anſwered by <hi>Drew,</hi> That although there be ſome difference betwixt ſuch Corporations, and that the words of the Statute are general <hi>(void to all intents, conſtructions, and purpoſes,)</hi> yet they ſhall conſtrued according to the meaning of the makers of the Act, whoſe ſcope was to provide for the Succeſſors, and not for the preſent Incumbent, and to the utter impoveriſhing of all Succeſſors, without any reſpect to the party himſelf, as it appeareth by the preamble of the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; where it is obſerved, That by long and unreaſonable Leaſes, the decay of Spiritual Livings is procured; for the remedying and preventing of which long Leaſes this Act was made, and that the Succeſſors ſhould not be bound thereby. And theſe Leaſes are not void, <hi>ſimpliciter ſed ſecundum quid, i. e.</hi> as to the Succeſſors: As upon the Statute of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 20. Diſcontinuances made by Women, &amp;c. ſhall be void and of none effect; yet ſuch a Diſcontinuance made is good againſt the Woman her ſelf: So upon the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> concerning Biſhops. See now <hi>Coke, Lincoln Colledge</hi> Caſe, 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the third Reports 60. A Leaſe made by Dean and Chapter not warranted by the ſaid Statute, ſhall not be void untill after the death of the Dean, who was party to the Leaſe. So upon the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of fraudulent Conveyances, ſuch fraudulent Conveyance is
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:53034:161"/>
not void againſt the Grantor, but againſt thoſe who are provided for by the ſaid Statute, and that the Leaſe in the principal caſe is not void, but voidable, all the Iuſtices agreed to be avoided by the Colledge, or any other who claim by it; and by <hi>Anderſon,</hi> If ſuch a Leaſe ſhould be void, then great miſchief would fall to the Colledge, for whoſe benefit this Statute was made, for if ſuch Leaſe be made rendring a ſmall Rent, then if before the defect be found or eſpied the Rent was arrear, the Colledge could not have remedy for the ſaid Rent. Alſo by <hi>Periam,</hi> Such a Leſſee might have an Action of Treſpaſs againſt a ſtranger, who entreth upon the Land, which proves that the Leaſe is not void, but voidable; and afterwards notwithſtanding all the Objections, Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff, and the chief Authority which moved <hi>Periam</hi> Iuſtice to be of ſuch opinion was <hi>Lemans</hi> caſe, cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 27. where a Leaſe was made to a Spiritual perſon againſt the Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and a Bond or Obligation for perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of covenants, and thereupon an Action was brought, and the Plaintiff therein had Iudgment and recovered, which could not have been if the Leaſe were utterly void againſt the Leſſor and Leſſee, as the very words of the Statute are, and although it is not alledged in the Book, that that was any cauſe of the Iudgment, yet in his opinion it was the greateſt cauſe of the Iudgment in that caſe.</p>

Hedges and Fences were in decay, and ſo juſtified: Vpon which the Plaintiff did demur in Law.

Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs againſt an Abbot, becauſe where the Plaintiff was Farmor of the King of his Hundred of <hi>D.</hi> and by reaſon thereof he might make At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, and diſtrain for the Debts of the King within the ſaid Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and where for a certain debt of the King he diſtrained the Beaſts of one <hi>A.</hi> and the Abbot made Reſcous; to which the Abbot ſaid, That he was Lord of the Manor of <hi>D.</hi> within which Manor there was this cuſtom, &amp;c. That if any Diſtreſs be taken within the ſaid Manor, that the ſame ſhould be put into the Pound of the ſaid Abbot of the ſame Manor, and not driven out of the Manor, and there ought the Diſtreſs to remain three days, ſo that if the party would agree within the three days, that then he ſhould have his Beaſts; and he ſaid, That the Plaintiff would have driven the ſaid Beaſts out of the ſaid Manor, and that he would not ſuffer him, upon which there was a demurrer, becauſe it is not any profit to the Abbot, but a charge to keep the Beaſts of another. Alſo he ſaid, That the King ſhall not be bound by ſuch a cuſtom as another perſon ſhall, whereupon Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff: So here in the principal caſe, There ſhall be no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the Defendant if the Wood be not fenced; for if his Cattel eſcape into the Wood he may juſtifie it, becauſe it is in default of the Plaintiffs incloſure: And if the Beaſts of the Plaintiff eſcape into the Lands of the Defendant, he may take them Damage Feaſant for the cauſe aforeſaid, 21 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 20. A Cuſtom is pleaded, That if any Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of the Manor ſhall take the Cattel of any one Damage Feaſant, and ſhall therefore diſtrain them, that then the Tenant ſo diſtraining them ought to bring them to the Lords Pound, which if he ſhall not do, at the next Court he ſhall be amerced in a certain ſum to the Lord of a Manor to be paid, and that was holden no good cuſtom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is againſt common Right, and the common Law; for by the common Law and common Reaſon, every one finding Cattel in his own Land Damage Feaſant may impound them in his own Land, and the Lord is not damnified thereby: So it is of a By-law, That every one who holdeth ſo many Acres of Lands in ſuch a Town, ſhall yearly pay a certain ſum of mony to the Church of the ſame Town, and ſhall forfeit for every default of payment thereof twenty pounds, ſuch By-law, although it hath continued time out of mind, yet it is not of any validity, becauſe for not payment of the ſaid ſum to the Church, the Lord of the Manor is not damnified, and therefore he ſhall not have any gain; contrary if the penalty had been limited to the Church-wardens, becauſe they are bound to repair the Church. Another Exception was taken to the form of the Preſcription <hi>(Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docunque eaedem ſepes &amp; defenſiones in decaſu extiterint)</hi> and that is too general, for ſo they might be in decay by his own default, as if he himſelf wrongfully pull up the Hedges, in which caſe there is no reaſon but that he ſhould repair them at his own coſts and charges, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ought to have pleaded <hi>cum in de caſu extiterint</hi> in the default of the Tenant of the Wood. Another Exception was taken, becauſe that here this cuſtom is pleaded particularly, and appropriated to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Acres only, and is not extended to the whole Manor; and to that purpoſe the caſe of 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 27. was cited, where a cuſtom is applied to

To which the Defendant pleaded, that heretofore the Plaintiff had brought againſt him an Action of Aſſault and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and wounding, and therein had Iudgment to recover, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution was ſued forth by <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and ſatisfaction acknowledged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Record,<note place="margin">Damages.</note> of 200 Marks aſſiſted by the Iury for the damages, and 11 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. de incremento</hi> by the Court, with averment of all identities. <hi>Cooper</hi> Serjeant, the ſame is a good Bar, and although that an Appeal, and an Action of Treſpaſs are diverſe Actions in nature, and in many circumſtances, yet as to the recovery of Damages, the one ſhall bind the other, See 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 17. a good caſe. In Treſpaſs for breaking of his Cloſe and Battery, the Defendant pleaded, that before that the Plaintiff by Bill in the Marſhalſey hath recovered his Damages for the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:53034:166"/>
ſame Treſpaſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and vouched the Record, and the Record was ſent, the which was varying from the Record pleaded; for the Record vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, was only of Battery without any thing of breaking of the Cloſe: and alſo the Battery is taxed at another day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with averment; yet as to the Battery it was holden good enough with averment, and as to the breaking of the Cloſe the Plaintiff had Iudgment, See 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>brev.</hi> 548. 12 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Coronae</hi> 110. and the Caſe betwixt <hi>Rider</hi> Plaintiff and <hi>Cobham</hi> Defendant, <hi>Paſch.</hi> 19 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 74. it was clearly holden and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged, that after a Recovery in Treſpaſs an Appeal of <hi>Maheim</hi> doth not lie; and the Book which deceives the Plaintiff is 22 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 82. where it is ſaid by <hi>Thorp,</hi> That notwithſtanding Recovery in Appeal of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim,</hi> yet he may after recover in Treſpaſs, but <hi>Non dicite contra. Popham</hi> contrary, the Plea in Bar is not good, for the Averment is, that the ſtroke and the wounding ſuppoſed in the Writ of Treſpaſs, and in his Appeal of <hi>Maheim</hi> are all one, but it is not averred that any damages were given for the <hi>Maheim,</hi> or that the <hi>Maheim</hi> was given in Evidence; for it might be, that there was not any <hi>Maheim</hi> when the Treſpaſs was brought, but that after by the drying of the wound it became a <hi>Maheim,</hi> and then the Action did riſe; as if a man upon a Contract promiſeth to pay me 10 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and other 10 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> if he doth not pay the 10 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> I may have an Action upon the promiſe for the not payment of that 10 <hi>l.</hi> and afterwards I may have another Action and recover damages for the not payment of the 10 <hi>l.</hi> at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> but if I do not begin any Action before <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> I cannot recover dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges but once, for the whole promiſe, and damages ſhall be given in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; and if I be diſſeiſed, I may recover damages for the firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and notwithſtanding that I ſhall have an Aſſiſe, and if I do reen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall have Treſpaſs and recover damages for the mean profits,<note place="margin">Ante 302.</note> and the damages recovered for the firſt Entry ſhall be recouped; and the Book cited before <hi>Fitz. Coronae</hi> 110, doth not make for the Defendant, but rather for the Plaintiff, for there it is averred, that the <hi>Maheim</hi> was given in Evidence, in the Action of Treſpaſs, which it is not in our Caſe. <hi>Egerton</hi> Solicitor, we have ſhewed, That <hi>ſucciſio venarum,</hi> in this appeal ſpecified is <hi>eadem ſucciſio &amp; vulneratio</hi> mentioned in the Treſpaſs. <hi>Coke,</hi> Although the identity of the wounding and cutting of the veins are averred, yet it is not averred, that the damages recovered in the Treſpaſs were given for this <hi>Maheim. Wray</hi> chief Iuſtice, The Iurors are to take conſideration of the wound in an action of Treſpaſs, and to give damages according to the hurt, and we ought to think that they have done accordingly, and if they have not ſo done, the party may pray that the Court by inſpection would adjudge upon it, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the damages: But now when the Iury hath given great dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>ſcil.</hi> 200 Marks, with which the party hath been contented, it ſhould be hard to give the Plaintiff another Action, and if there be any ſuch ſpecial matter, that it was not become a <hi>Maheim</hi> at the time of the Action of Treſpaſs brought, but it is become a <hi>Maheim</hi> of later time by drying, the Plaintiff ought to have ſhewed the ſame to the Court, and ſo have helped himſelf, for otherwiſe it ſhall not be ſo intended, but that the averment made by the Defendant, is good enough to ouſt the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff of this Action; and the Iudgment cited 19 <hi>Eliz.</hi> before, was given by me, after I was conſtituted chief Iuſtice, and this Bar as I conceive was drawn out of the pleading in 19 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and afterwards Iudgment was given againſt the Plaintiff.</p>

In Aſſiſe againſt Tenant and diſſeiſor, each of them may have a Writ of Error, and the reverſal by the one ſhall make void the Record as to both, and he needs not any Garniſhment, for by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendment the King is to have all his goods, and the King is always preſumed preſent in this Court, <hi>quod tota Curia conceſſit;</hi> and therefore there needs not any Garniſhment by <hi>Scire facias;</hi> but <hi>Wray</hi> ſaid, we uſe in ſuch caſes to call the Attorney General of the King to know if he can ſay any thing wherefore the Outlawry ſhould not be reverſed.
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:53034:170"/>
The Error aſſigned was, That the Exigent iſſued forth into <hi>London</hi> and the Sheriff returned, that he had proclaimed the party <hi>de Com. in Com. quouſque, &amp;c.</hi> where he ought ſay, <hi>de Huſtingo in Huſtingum,</hi> and that was holden by the Court clearly to be Error; and afterwards at another day it was moved by <hi>Coke,</hi> That a man attainted of Felony could not make Executors, for he is dead in Law, and as <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſolus Deus facit Haeredes &amp; homo nominat Executores,</hi> and therefore the Heir only ſhall have a Writ of Error: alſo an Executor cannot have a Writ of Error, but only upon a Iudgment given in a perſonal Action; but this Attainder is a thing of a higher nature: as where a Woman poyſoneth her Husband, the Heir ſhall not have an Appeal, for Murder is changed into Treaſon, and that offence is a thing of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo this Attainder is of a higher nature than in the perſonalty. Alſo it may be miſchievous to the Heir, for the Executor may forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with bring and purſue his Writ of Error, by which the Iudgment ſhall be affirmed, and ſo the right of the Heir ſhall be bound; alſo when Error is brought to reverſe an Outlawry of Felony, a <hi>Scire facias</hi> ought to be ſued againſt the Lords mediate and immediate, which cannot be here at the Suit of the Executors: alſo it was found by Enqueſt of the Coroner, that the Teſtator <hi>fugam fecit,</hi> ſo that thereby if he had been acquitted, he ſhall loſe his goods, and then the Executors have not any reaſon to bring this Writ of Error; but ſee 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Error</hi> 51. That Executors ſhall have a Writ of Error of an Outlawry pronounced againſt their Teſtator, and if it be rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed they ſhall have reſtitution of the goods of the Teſtator; but it doth not appear there that it was upon an Indictment of Felony. <hi>Altham,</hi> As well the Executor as the Heir is a perſon able for to ſue a Writ of Error in ſuch caſe, as 13 <hi>E.</hi> 4. where a falſe oath is given againſt one in Aſſiſe and dieth, the Heir ſhall have an Attaint for the Land, and the Executor in reſpect of the damages. <hi>Popham</hi> Attorney General, This Outlawry is a real Iudgment, therefore the Executor cannot have Error upon it. <hi>Wray,</hi> It is good that this caſe be conſidered, for it may be miſchievous, for thereby the Executor ſhall avoid the Attainder againſt the King and the Lords. <hi>Fenner,</hi> That cannot be without a <hi>Scire facias. Gawdy,</hi> The Executors ſhall have this Action; and as to that which hath been objected, that the party attainted cannot make Executors, the ſame is no reaſon, for the Executors do pretend that their Teſtator was not lawfully outlawed, and ſo by this Suit they do endeavour to take away that diſability, and therefore it ought not to be objected againſt the Executor; and if the Caſe here be, That the Teſtator had not lands, but only goods, there is no reaſon but that the Executors ſhould have a Writ of Error, otherwiſe the goods of the Teſtator ſhould be loſt; and it was clearly holden by <hi>Wray</hi> chief Iuſtice, That the Executor might have and purſue this Writ of Error, the Outlawry of the Teſtator notwithſtanding; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Outlawry was reverſed accordingly.</p>

tenura &amp; occupatione</hi> of <hi>Goodman</hi> and others; but he did not ſhew by what Title, Diſſeiſin or Leaſe, or other Title, &amp;c. <hi>Buckley</hi> contrary, And he ſaid, This unity of poſſeſſion is not any diſcharge of Tithes by the ſaid Statute; and as to the Caſe cited before, of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. where Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in tail of a Rent entreth upon the Tenant of the Land, now is the Rent ſuſpended, and then after when he makes a Feoffment in fee, by that Feoffment the Rent is extinguiſhed, which was but ſuſpended at the time of the Feoffment; and therefore ſome have holden, that if after ſuch Entry he makes a Leaſe for life of the Land, that his Rent or Seigniory is utterly gone <hi>in perpetuum,</hi> for by the Livery all paſſeth out of him, which he ſaid cannot be Law; and ſo it ſeemed to <hi>Gawdy</hi> Iuſtice, Then upon ſuch Feoffment with warranty he could not vouch as of Land diſcharged of the Rent generally, but as of Land diſcharged at the time of the Feoffment, which proves that the ſuſpenſion is not a diſcharge, for it was ſuſpended before the Feoffment, and diſcharged by the Feoffment, and ſo ſuſpenſion is not a diſcharge, <hi>à fortiori</hi> in the Caſe of Tithes, for in the caſe of Common, and Rent, although they are ſuſpended ſo as they cannot be actually taken, yet they are to ſome intent <hi>in eſſe:</hi> As where Lands holden of other Lords are in the hands of the King for <hi>Primer ſeiſin</hi> by reaſon of Prerogative, and during ſuch ſeiſin of the King the Lord gets ſeiſin, the ſame is a good ſeiſin not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that it was ſuſpended ſo as he could not diſtrain: And alſo in Aſſize of Land, damages as to the Rent out of the Land ſhall be recouped, therefore the rent in ſome ſort is <hi>in eſſe,</hi> and <hi>à multo fortiori,</hi> this Tithe (which is a thing of common Right) ſhall be <hi>in eſſe,</hi> but goes with the Land,<note place="margin">A Rent <hi>in eſſe</hi> to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended to other.</note> and therefore by unity of poſſeſſion ſhall not be ſuſpended, 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. He who hath liberty of Warren in the Lands of another entreth into the Land, the Warren is not ſuſpended, nor by Feoffment of the Land is extinct; and in this Caſe upon the matter, during the unity of poſſeſſion the Tithes were paid, although not <hi>in ſpecie:</hi> Alſo the Abbot had the Tithes as Parſon of <hi>B.</hi> and the Land as Abbot, and therefore no ſuſpenſion, for the Tithes were always <hi>in eſſe,</hi> although not taken in the manner, as Tithes commonly are, but by way of Retainer, 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 44. A Writ of Annuity is brought againſt a Prior, and it appeared, That the Prior and his Succeſſors have uſed to pay the Annuity as Parſon of <hi>D.</hi> and not as Priors, which Parſonage was appointed to the ſaid Priory time out of mind, and in the Writ the Defendant was named Prior only, and not Parſon, and therefore the Writ was abated. See 14 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 4. 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. In an Action of Waſt: So <hi>Bracebridges</hi> Caſe, 14 <hi>Eliz. Plowd.</hi> 420. The Caſe put by <hi>Catiline,</hi> If the Parſon, Patron and Ordinary make a Leaſe for years, and afterwards the Leſſee becomes there Incumbent, the Term is not extinct, for he hath the Term in his own Right, and the inheritance in the Right of his Church, which ſee 30 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 43. A Parſon purchaſeth, and after leaſeth his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, he himſelf ſhall pay Tithes notwithſtanding this Vnity; and as to the reaſon of the other ſide, That if ſuch diſcharge of Tithes be not intended by the Statute, but only a Diſcharge in Law, the Statute ſhould be in vain, the ſame is not ſo; for if the Abbot had been diſcharged by way of Releaſe of Compoſition, for the Monaſtery being diſſolved the Appropriation had been good, if it had not been ſupported by the Statute, and then the Releaſe and Compoſition of no force, and the King ſhould not take advantage of it but by this Statute; and as to <hi>Whartons</hi> Caſe before cited, the ſame cannot be Law, for it hath been holden upon the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of <hi>Confirmations,</hi> That if an Infant maketh a Leaſe to the King, the ſame is not made good by the Statute, for the ſaid Statute extends to imperfections in circumſtances, and not in ſubſtance. And although the Leaſe be not good, yet becauſe the matter of the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is naught, although our Bar be naught, a Conſultation ought to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:53034:174"/>
be granted, alſo our Leaſe is well pleaded, and if ſuch defect be in it, as hath been objected, the ſame ought to come in by Plea on the other ſide; and it is not like <hi>Heydons</hi> Caſe, for there it was found by ſpecial Verdict, not to <hi>Cromwells</hi> Caſe, where ſuch defect was in the Declaration, and ſo no ground of Action; as to the Traverſe it is good enough, as if ſpecial Baſtardy be pleaded againſt one born before the marriage, and ſo Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard, the other party ſhall traverſe generally the Baſtardy, and not the ſpecial matter, but for the principal matter, <hi>i.</hi> this unity of poſſeſſion, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers rules have been. 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Common Pleas, the Caſe was, An Abbot had a Manor within the Pariſh of <hi>D.</hi> and a Compoſition was made betwixt the Parſon of <hi>D.</hi> and the ſaid Abbot, that the Parſon ſhould have yearly certain Loads of Wood, out of thirty Acres of the ſaid Manor, for, and in recompence of all the Tithes of Wood there, afterwards the Parſonage was appropriated to the ſaid Abbot, and afterwards the houſe was diſſolved, and the Manor granted to one, and the Rectory to another, and it was holden, That the portion of the Tithes was removed, for he had them, <hi>ſcil.</hi> The Manor and the Tithes in ſeveral Rights. And <hi>Manwood</hi> Chief Baron, and <hi>Periam</hi> Iuſtice, to whom a Caſe depending in the Chancery was referred concerning the diſcharge of Tithes by unity of poſſeſſion, delivered their opinions, That ſuch an Vnity is not any diſcharge within the ſaid Statute. It was adjorned.</p>
